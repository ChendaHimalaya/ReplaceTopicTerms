Be prepared for no one that you call at this hotel to know anything and to get a different answer to your same question every time you ask. Be prepared for hidden fees that you will have to pay upon check out,8/18/19,1
I can not understand how a man in front of guest réception try to steal a suit case (about half Past TwoPm) on 14th of july...While security agent was Stand up on the stairs of the entrance of the hôtel.. This man was catched up by the owner of the suit case ...but he was out in few seconds... During this incident i was waiting in the hall with a few Customers to get our rooms..,8/4/19,3
"This hotel had very few amenities, not even an outside area within the hotel property to sit outside. No swimming pool, and was not aware of a fitness center. We had to call to front desk/housekeeping to request towels and a fridge several times, and the front door staff hit on us several times ",7/24/19,2
"Why charge a quest this fee if they don't use it, You can keep track by the use of the room key for entrance to the gym. You have on file who uses it . Then charge those quest who use the gym but charge quest who don't ",7/10/19,4
"After prepaying, we arrived and were told we could not stay at ROW NYC because they had overbooked and booked us into a lesser quality hotel. We were meeting friends who were visiting from overseas, staying at ROW and had plans to stay with us. Don't take your chances, do not stay here, there are better hotels in NYC, just not this one. ",6/26/19,1
"Close to very fine restaurants , night clubs and other entertainment with the bright lights of Time Square in walking distance. Walking distance to major corporations for business meetings and MSG and Penn Station where trains can go in all directions ",6/11/19,5
Check in takes a long time. Rooms are small and not cleaned properly. On one day we had to ask several times for towels & the room to be cleaned. It was finally cleaned at 8pm and only then could we shower,5/21/19,1
Booked through AirBnB. Charged resort fee and taxes on arrival. This is not discussed in the agreement and specifically forbidden in the confirmation email. Hotel notified 3 days ago through AirBnB... SIlence,5/10/19,1
"A lot of hip European guests - a plus. If you want to be amongst Times Square area's frenetic pace, and don't mind a lobby that has music at a high decibel (think nightclub volume), then this is the place for you ",5/9/19,4
"This was just a standard small New York City room. It was nothing special, just adequate. The next time I am in New York City I will definitely search for a different hotel to stay at. The elevators could definitely use some work ",5/7/19,4
"We chose ROW NYC because my wife has limited mobility and it was very close to the show we were attending and a restaurant where we met with friends. There was a mix-up on our reservation for an ADA-compliant room and Hotel Associate ""Douglas"" when above and beyond the call to make matters right. If we go back to NYC for another visit to see shows we'll make the ROW our first choice for accommodations ",4/15/19,5
"I live in NJ and whenever my wife and I go into the city for a long weekend, we stay at ROW NYC, previously the Milford Plaza. Its not only convenient to just about everything but it's reasonably priced for the city. Stay here and you won't regret it ",2/26/19,5
"first time saying here and I will be back, it’s just were you need to be, right in the heart of the city only a few blocks from time square, 42nd street etc, I even walked to ground zero, just over an hours walk ",2/4/19,5
"Don't get back to the hotel after 11.30pm expecting a nightcap in the bar ~ not going to happen. Bar shut, even for residents. Don't expect a lunchtime drink either. Bar shut with surly staff cleaning after breakfast. Eight lifts, but seem to be allocated to certain floors ~ waited 15 mins for a lift one morning ~ quicker and easier to walk down 17 flights. Definitely will not be returning. ",1/30/19,3
"Row NYC is exactly what you need and nothing you don’t. Nothing extravagant, just a hip and environmentally friendly place to stay while visiting NYC. Plenty to eat and experience right in the hotel, and tons more right outside the door. ",1/28/19,5
Make room bigger as well as bathroom. He dresser and bed leave no room to get in between. If you are taller than 5’8 the bed is not long enough for you. if you are bigger than a petite size 4 the you can get in between the dresser and bed without having to crawl over the bed and the radiator is so LOUD. Kept me and my boyfriend up all night because it is literally an arm and half length from the bed and it makes clanking noises all night,1/25/19,1
"Stayed here 13th January for 3 days , what a rip off this hotel is , you get charged resort fee and a breakage deposit, resort fee is a rip off when you dont use water bottles, gym, phone calls and computers but you still have to pay , didn’t get water bottles and water and ice machine didn’t work on our floor and was told to go to 23rd floor if wanted water and ice when there was one on our floor why should we then have to go 5 floors up it should work , if you haven’t got a credit card then resort fee is doubled if payin cash , resort fee only goes up to 4am on your check out day anything after that you get charged extra, rooms are really small , sliding door to bathroom doesn’t close fully , we stayed in Gallivant last year and was only charged $75 dollars breakage and got it back, wont stay here again , ignorant staff , dont care about customers as long as they are taking peoples money, absolutely disgusting ",1/17/19,2
"Great room, simple, and quick, there is a $30 fee per night for facilities which hotels.com didnt reflect on the ""this is what you will pay"" and was at the bottom of the email confirmation. Hotel was very close to the main attraction in NY ",12/28/18,5
Just stayed there for 5 nights while in NYC. Away from 7AM to 8PM but nobody cleaned the room... called 3 times to get someone bringing towels + shampoos and finally receptionist staff hang up the line...nobody care..,12/2/18,1
"This hotel could do a better job on the cleaning. Cleaning of all commin areas, elevators, rooms and bathrooms. Staff didnt clean our room at right times, left trash food bag in the room after cleaning. Sheets were not very crisp. No coffee maker in the room. ",11/15/18,3
"Arrived Thursday at 12.00 pm with 2 friends on getting our room it hadn’t been cleaned so we decided to leave our luggage with in our friends room , and off we went ! Returned around 9.00 pm room still not cleaned ! Went to desk and was told to return back to room in 45 mins and it would be sorted ! gave it 1 hour .You guessed it ! Nothing ! After being very tired I went looking for a cleaner to no avail ! But did find the cleaning store so I got new sheets,bedding ,towels ,soaps toiletries and did it myself !!!! The hotel said they would take all the taxes off but on receipt of the final bill they only took them off for that night ! Which was next to nothing  ",11/11/18,1
"The facility fee was totally not expected in the fianl bil, never discloed on the booking or on arrrival. The elevators not working, need to wait 5 to 10 minutes to get one. The room (carpet) was not clean ",10/29/18,2
There was some kind of plastic laid over the bathtub but there were holes in it which had been repaired with sealing agent. The plastic was still leaking so there was old bathwater under it which squeezed out when you stepped on the plastic (ugh!). The wall behind the TV was falling apart. The air conditioning was noisy so I turned it of but it was still like you were in an airplane. Thought I would get a better room at a four star hotel for this price,10/23/18,2
"rooms premium price was not reflected in sloppy paint work / cleanliness of room. room needed a deep cleaning, paint needed to be redone throughout the room, cracked tub liner needed to be repaired. room needed some hel ",10/19/18,3
"small rooms and bathrooms' air condition didn't work, very noisy everywhere a lot of noise from the air conditioning system even when its nor working, noise from the rooms nearby, front desk didnt hel ",10/11/18,2
"Please, dont offer room 1532 to any guest... it shouldnt be consider as a room... the noise the elevator make everytime it goes up and down can be heard clearly in that room... its like a torture... i asked for a room changed but had to stay a night there anyways because all the other rooms were full. Was not a nice place to start my trip at N ",10/9/18,3
Nothing was complimentary in the hotel . In fact the last day extension I paid extremely high amount . I didn't like the tip culture. What is the staff is being paid for by the hotel is the customer has to tip for everything from carrying the baggage to the room till keeping it in the clock room,9/5/18,3
"This hotel has extra fatility fee even though you don't use any of facilities at all. When you book this hotel, you need to consider about it in advance. I paid extra $100 for two days which was not in my budget. ",8/31/18,2
The Hotel is strategically placed for good business but it is gradually deteriorating in cleanliness. Myself and my family kept sneezing throughout the night during bed time due excessive dust in the rooms,8/30/18,2
"I wouldn't suggest this hotel after staying in it simply because there were cockroaches in the gym area, then the bellboy broke my luggage, the wheel came off completely, he never apologized or offered help, and the room was tiny.. ",8/23/18,1
"4 stars? neary half an hour to check inNobody anwers the room service, nor returns the messages in the voice mailno soap, no shampoo, no room serviceCreepy elevators, and no concierge or always on the phone...very long queue everywher ",8/5/18,1
"Been staying at the Row since it was the Manhattan hotel. Built in 1928 it has stayed current with remodels and remains my favorite hotel. Location, staff and cleanliness. It’s a bargain. The proximity to Times Square is so convenien ",7/31/18,5
"Would stay at the ROW again, but will make sure to ask questions about what their rates will be per night and will they change if I have to change my original reservation. It served our purpose and was in the right location for our excursions ",7/30/18,4
Central location close to everything. Need to make sure access to elevators is only for people staying in the hotel. Having two people checking for card keys may not be enough. Hallways seemed to need an up-keep,7/19/18,3
The price was different I book on booking. Still pushing to return part of the charges on my credit card. I forgot headphones on my room the checkout day and until 72 hours I didn't have any new. I am going to claim,7/13/18,3
"Overall the room is more of a motel standard rather than hotel level. I will not recommend this hotel for the price they charge! The only plus point is the location, but the room size, cleanliness of room and the bathroom is below standard! ",6/27/18,1
"Very noisy room, door in front of ice machine, couldn’t sleep the 3 nights I stayed at the hotel.On the phone they gave me the wrong price of parking, they had told me it would be 45$ for the whole stay as long as I don’t move the car during the stay, it turned out to be 70$/night!! ",6/26/18,2
"The manager Walked me because I was not staying multiple nights. The desk clerk (who I have checked in with on multiple occasions) was assigning me a room, discussing the breakfast included, etc. Then the manager interrupted. It was not a pleasant situation. ",6/22/18,1
"And not even a coffee maker. Thank goodness for Dunkin Donuts. Besides it being a close, neutral location to various events the rest was a let down. Each time we asked a concierge how to get somewhere, we were misdirected. They were close.. ",6/20/18,2
"Third time staying at this property and we continue to return because of the location. Extremely close to theaters, restaurants and the subway. Wish the rooms were a little bigger, but it's New York and most hotel rooms tend to be on the smaller side ",6/15/18,5
"The room was not clean every day. The reservasion was supposed to be for breakfast but they have been removed for the same price. Booking.com have seen me for the last time, i will do business with expedia next time. ",6/11/18,1
No welcome greeting when checking in & no apologies for a long wait. Hotel was aware our stay was a special occasion which they advised they documented but reception didn’t mention this. After I pointed this out they said they will arrange a complimentary bottle of wine for my wife 40th. Again no apology for not picking up on the special occasion. No bottle of wine was ever delivered to our room even after I enquired about this nothing more was done by them. Bathroom wasn’t clean as you would expect hairs in bath & carpet not hoovered. Also room carpet was the same & crumbs at side of bed. Two lamps either side of the bed where covered in dust not what you expect from a 4* hotel. The bathroom door had a hole in it after something had been taken off the door & was left just as it was with the old colour underneath whatever was on the door completely different colour to the door. Don’t stay here we only slept in the room the minute we where ready to go out we stayed out till time to go to bed. We also witnessed hotel staff arguing with guest rather than trying to help them,6/3/18,1
Rooms were small. Could not sleep in due to the noise coming right outside the door that you could hear everything because the rooms were so small. There was throw up in elevator E. Hotel staff was hard to find any help.,5/24/18,2
"This hotel isn't fancy, but you can't beat its location and price! The hotel is located right next to Times Square. There is a subway stop mere feet from the entrance, and Broadway is right out the door ",5/15/18,4
I left my luggage in the hotel was well received and when I returned to the room the receptionist was in a bad mood. What was before she even finished answering because he doesn't speak English and she had no patience,4/24/18,3
"The Row is not a Hotel but a Hostel a Factory, you pay way too much for a broomcloset room (1036) 1032/1033 you will sleep in the elavator, breakfast you eat of a paper plate, we ran To Millenium hote ",4/24/18,1
"Entrance, guests next to us were a bit loud but that is not related to the hotel experience. Very fast service when asking for towels, extra pillows. Food in the area caters to tourists so just go one block in any direction and there are better choice ",4/18/18,4
"Need room service to be an option. Full breakfast choices like French toast , bacon etc... you need a front waiter in front of Dm restaurant to help if a guest questions as where to sit or wait to be seated ",4/17/18,3
"I was given a different room category feom what I’ve booked, my view was only partial, my room was not cleaned three times in a week, hairdryer was ot working and the hotel lost one of my orders. Also, they charged me $149 to receive orders. ",4/11/18,2
"When checking out we discussed with receptionist Fernanda what had happened last night. She tried to call the time manager or manager but she did not show up, gave an explanation that she was in a meeting, and it would be long, but they were going to pass on our ordeal to management ",4/4/18,1
"The hotel met my needs, but it didn’t exceed them. It was cramped (to be expected in NY). It mostly just seemed old and not very clean. It wasn’t disgusting , but there were a few hairs in the bathroom, soap scum in the sink, and the windows sills had not been dusted in ages ",3/30/18,3
"When I booked online via Amoma. com, I have paid Amoma.com the fee for the one night to stay at the ROW NYC hotel. Yet, when I arrived there that night, ROW NYC asked for my credit card and charged me again,Amoma.com charged me HKD $1,097, and then ROW NYC charged me HKD $1,506.51 + $560.07 (deposit)Now I have double paid the hotel for 1 night, would either Amoma.com or Row NYC please returm money back to me please ",3/20/18,2
"I only stay when we are in tech rehearsals of new Broadway show on the same block. We work 8am until midnight and I don't want to commute to Long Island during this time. I always stay at The Row NYC and get more sleep, rest and relaxation and peace for a few hours. The result is I am fresh and alert in the mornings to face another da ",3/15/18,5
I am 20 years old and this was my first experience of renting a hotel for my girlfriend and I. I could not have asked for more. For the price this hotel is just what I was looking for. Time square is right around the corner and plenty of great places to grab food nearby,3/12/18,4
"I had to stay here because of the nor'easter and it was filthy. I had hair on my pillow case, towels and bathroom floor. When I tried called guest services to ask for help the phone kept ringing for almost 10 minutes until I gave up. I thought I checked into a room that hadn't been cleaned. ",3/11/18,1
"I booked on what I thought was there website but must have been booking.com. I booked a standard room with a queen bed. On check in the desk clerk said, Oh, I'm not going to give you that room, I'm giving you better. Better turned out to be a room with a double bed. We are not double bed size folks. It was late when I check in so I asked on check out. They said oh well, that's what booking.com changed it to. Buyer beware. ",3/6/18,4
"I've been going to this hotel for a long time, always my first choice in NYC. Close to everything, but especially Broadway Theaters. And if you want to go outside the midtown sector, you're close to a lot of subway lines at 42 nd Street, Times Square MTA station. ",1/27/18,5
Please stay away from room 832 at all cost. The room was behind the elevators and it felt like you sleeping next to the Subway. Literally. Please have them switch immediately if you’re assigned to that roo,1/25/18,2
"I was freezing. A radiator was brought and I was told not to adjust it. I went back to sleep and woke boiling! Another day I had no hot water in shower or sink. Some of the receptionists chew gum. The breakfast opened late and the staff were a bit indignant when asked why ""we're still getting ready"" ",1/20/18,3
The online pre-checking was not working and the 1-800 to pre-check would drop the call (5 times). The front desk was a disaster ad they did not seem to care. Rooms are very smallThe online pre-checking was not working and the 1-800 to pre-check would drop the call (5 times,1/3/18,2
"I found the hotel very noisy and overcrowded. Staff was always very busy and not ready to help. They charge $30 facilities fee for ""internet use"" (?). Corridors were not clean, rooms small and not very comfortable. ",1/1/18,1
"The 4* starts should be review and it doesn’t deserve more than 2*. The staff service is nil, they deal with complaints every day and when you go for a problem they don’t solve because they have a line of unsatisfied customers ",8/25/19,1
The ROW was a great place to stay. Walking distance to main subway terminal and in the heart of everything you could want. The staff were friendly and helpful. For being a solo traveler I felt safe and was a fantastic experience.,8/25/19,5
"My husband and I have stayed at Row NYC twice, the second time being part of our honeymoon in the USA. Guy on the reception was extremely friendly, and stated that the rooms are pretty much the same, but upgraded us to a higher floor - for a better view.The rooms are quite basic, however, when in NYC you don't need much. The beds were clean and comfy, the bathroom a good size and clean. And the black out blinds were ideal. Lift system is great, punching in your floor number, to avoid having to stop on every floor :)Free Wifi available - which was great for facetiming family back home :)The lobby to the hotel is lovely, with a shop and computers to use. Row NYC is in a perfect location, with only about a 5 minute walk to Times Sq and multiple eateries within close proximity. During our stay, we broke our suitcase and had to buy another one, my husband spoke to the hotel porter to see where we could dispose of this, and he said that if we gave it to him, he would happily do this for us. We've stayed here twice before and will more than likely stay here again ",8/25/19,4
Enjoy the city scape view. Beds are clean and crisp. Bathroom was large and well stocked with towels and toiletries. Blow dryer and cold air! Centralized area lots of places to visit and see. Everything close by,8/24/19,4
Great location. Great value. Really enjoyed our stay. Would recommend to anyone traveling to New York and wants to stay close to Times Square. Check in was easy and everyone was friendly. Room was small but clean and comfortable,8/24/19,5
"The only positive note about this hotel is the location, very close to Time Square and the view of the exterior rooms. For the rest it is a structure that needs a renovation and a greater care and cleaning of the rooms and bathrooms. Air conditioning in public areas is excessively cold ",8/24/19,3
"We arrived and found a room in badly kept state and with dirty sheets. Hardly what we wanted to find at 9:30pm. We immediately reported this to staff and half an hour later, nothing had been done. We requested that this be resolved while we left the hotel for dinner. Upon our return, at around 11pm, we found that a new set of bedding had been left folded in our room (but had not actually been put on the bed). When we began to put on the sheets ourselves we discovered that this second set of bedding was also stained. Not only that, but the mattress itself was stained and had not been cleaned, as it was covered with a previous guest's hair. When we called the front desk and housekeeping to request a room change (because reasonably, we did not want to sleep on a dirty mattress), we were told that at that time, they could send up new sheets (even though they had already done so), but could not actually have someone put them on the bed, could not have someone clean the mattress and could not switch our room. Twenty minutes later, nothing had been done. When we contacted the front desk again, one helpful worker let us know that she could, in fact, switch our room. However, when she went to do so, the hotel's system was no longer working. Around midnight-12:30am, we were finally given a new room. Though the room was upgraded and clean, it was still in poor state. Multiple furniture pieces were broken (most notably, the tv stand), and there was an intense smell of marihuana in the corridor. We did not report this given that at this point, we just wanted to sleep. Given that we were paying over a hundred dollars a night plus a facilities fee for the room, the least we expected was a clean and well kept room. Otherwise, the facilities fee can hardly be justified. Though the lady who finally helped us at the front desk was very kind (unfortunately, I cannot remember her name) the remainder of the staff seemed unfazed by the issue, and she was the only person to apologize ",8/23/19,1
"Don't expect alot. When we arrived they told me I was lucky to have a room as they overbooked by four rooms and others would be turned away later that day. What kind of service is that. When we tried to call in while driving to the hotel, to confirm our reservation we were sent on a phone goose chase. This went on for FIVE HOURS!! We were told by the 1-800 to call the front desk but no one would answer. We made 20+ calls to the hotel. When we arrived the front desk told us they don't answer the phone ever as they are to busy to answer calls. It was crazy and I was so very frustrated. We booked a couple's vacation with two rooms. The rooms were very small,both dirty, our shower was broken, the washroom was dirty and food was found behind the desk. We booked the room with the understanding we were getting a queen bed but we both got rooms with two double beds. Pretty romantic!!! While we were there we got the generic email asking how our stay was, I clicked on the response link to the manager and sent him an email with my concerns. They didn't even reply. You are paving good money for the location, not the hotel. If you expect average you wont be to let down. Also the elevators are a pain to use. I personaly would book another place next time, for sure. The food was ok and the staff were only ok as well. ",8/23/19,2
"The room is small(it's New York), and the window is locked. View is good, but the air quality inside the room is poor. Service is good. Angela Figueroa, one of the waiters, did her job especially good ",8/23/19,4
"Tiny room with very bad ventilation, most rooms without airvents in bathroom, stuffed to the max! Really bad attitude of the staff especially those at reception/concierge. The only people were friendly, one housekeeper on 22nd floor and the door man entrance to the streets. Given a choice I wouldn't choose this hotel at all! They say that's how people in NYC behave, I say why can't you, in customer service line, be different, be friendly! ",8/23/19,1
"Everything was amazing, the best place in ny. Mr. juonir from the front desk was amazing. He is more than just employed. He try to help us whatever we need more than we expected and we very appreciate that. The room was clean. ",8/22/19,5
"The experience was great, the only issues I had was that the lobby smelled a bit like sewage and the wi-fi was a bit spotty. The rooms were incredibly clean, the staff were very kind and quick to get their job done, there was almost nothing wrong, again the only issues I had were the smell in the lobby and the quality of the wireless internet ",8/22/19,4
"The hotel is located in a central location in Times Square. However, there were a few things I was disappointed about. First of all, the service needs a lot of improvement. The front desk told us at check in that they will email us once the room is ready but we didnt get any email. Second, the staff at the luggage drop off area were plain rude and entitled. First of all, they demanded for tips as we requested to leave our luggage since we couldn’t checked in yet. They weren’t nice to us when we approached them as well and to demand for tips with poor service? There’s no way. Also, I requested for city view weeks in advance but we were only given a wall view of the next building. it was also highly disappointing that the sliding door of the bathroom was difficult to open without someone opening it for u. My friend almost got stuck in the bathroom as she couldn’t open the door. I will never stay at this hotel again ",8/22/19,1
"The bathroom door didn’t work, the shades were dirty, the windows needed washing and the whole place needs to be updated. Paint was thick, tub and toilet looked like 70’s hospital room. Not worth the money spent ",8/21/19,2
Horrible service and did not cater to the public! When an customer complains about something you need to understand what they are saying and compensate them for it instead of pushing it off on the next person in the hotel! Don’t be rude to the customers and treat them with respect!,8/21/19,2
"Hi There! We just checked in today @ 4pm. And we arrived here in our room with those kind of sheets. Is that a 4star standard? I went to the desk and report what happened. They told me, they’ll be here after 10mins. But then, we waited for half an hour, no one appeared. Then, I called the desk and remind about our room, they transferred my call to housekeeping department. Housekeeping department told me, we need to get out of the room because housekeeper can’t do the service when people are inside the room and they’ll be here in 15 minutes. And we did. We even had our early dinner. We came back and still, no one came to change these sheets! I even put a note!!!!! Seriously???? We came back after 1hr and a half!!! Again, is this your 4 star standard ROW NYC? Plus, the elevator stinks. •UNHELPFUL CONCIERGE •TERRIBLE SMALL ROO ",8/21/19,1
"The location is nothing short of perfect. Check in and out were quick, rooms very clean - some with great views, efficient elevator system. some with good size and great views. Other rooms have poorly positioned toilets in relation to the front and side walls. It is impossible to sit with your legs extended, even for someone under 180cm. Be very careful if you receive a room key ending 11 ",8/21/19,4
"Row Hotel is well located if you have been in the city before, you know where you are and where to go. If it is the first time you are in nyc I would not recommend it at all, since the hotel is located una street where everything looks like a very populated and somewhat dirty neighborhood. The hotel has an open kitchen and bar. So they make parties where they let everyone in. When you go to your hotel you are somewhat looking for privacy and that is exactly what you don’t get. There are like a hundred people coming in and out and there is no one to see if they are guests or not. I even got asked by a stranger if he borrow my phone and laptop. ",8/21/19,2
"very disappointed, quality of bed, size of bed, room not clean, dust everywhere, fingerprint, airco noisy, very approximative clean of the whole room, need to be refreshed, personal ok but just minimum, need a card to enter the reception toilets? ",8/21/19,1
"I’ve stayed here a few times beginning about 5 years ago for the first visit. The first time was pretty good. Subsequent times it started going down hill. It is now over crowded,, run-down, loud, understaffed, dirty and run down. After a one week stay at Paper Factory in Long Island City, we trekked to JFK. My flight got canceled and rebooked and so we had to book a hotel. Rather then journey back to where we had been staying, we chose to spend the night at the ROW. Upon arrival I waited ;40 min to check in. No one could provide me with water. They had dented their bar are out for a private event and it was a a rap dj with a bad sound system that was so loud you could here it on the busy NY street outside. It appeared to be a fire hazard bc there were about 300 people crammed into this space gyrating, drinking and making a ton of noise. This is the bar area and lounge open to the lobbbh where hotel guests can usually grab a drink and relax. Nope! I could hardly hear the reservations agents as I checked in.The staff (all two of them) looked annoyed, frazzled and tired and were unfriendly. Upon arriving in my room, the window was wide open and it was 90 degrees. I tired to turn a/c on but yep it was broken. I had to go back down and stand in line again to get a maintenance person sent up. ’this delayed us stepping around the block for a quick bite. The room was small and dated. The tub had black mold and no shower curtain so the water hit the toilet and the floor in the tiny bathroom. It felt more like a cruise ship. The bed was uncomfortable and thankfully we had a ride to leave to LGGA the next morning early but in hindsight I would've c chosen another hotel bc the check in was a big pain. It was not wheat we had hoped for after a very long day filled with mass transit and airports . I would like to get a refund but when I called the front desk it would ring with no answer. If anyone has a way of contacting a manager please let me know. It was a terrible experience e ",8/20/19,1
"I stayed at the Row on 7/31/2019 and my expectations were pretty low given the proximity to the tourist epicenter Times Square. Despite being a high volume and very busy tourist hotel, I was beyond astounded by the service I received. After a tiring road trip from Boston to NYC, all I wanted was a ""quite"" room and a good night's rest. Douglas, the hotel assistant who checked me in provided me with the most amazing room I've ever stayed at! I felt like I was on vacation vs a business trip and I go the most incredible night's sleep. It was a sanctuary. Douglas was extremely courteous, empathetic and provided me a top room. The next day, I needed to print out a presentation for a meeting and once again, the staff went the extra mile to print out my entire presentation. I was incredibly satisfied to the point where I booked another room on 8/26/2019 - I look forward to staying at the Row again. Thanks Douglas and Team Row! ",8/20/19,5
"We stayed here because my boyfriend was attending a conference nearby. The room was small but good enough for just the two of us. We had to request new linen because the sheets had a stain on them. other than that this was a great stay. great location right in the heart of times square, next to everything. a great value location wise ",8/20/19,4
This was the most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed at. I wasn’t expecting 5 star service but I was expecting a CLEAN room and hotel. Our room was so dirty. There were pistachio shells and a toenail on the bed and other gross things I don’t even want to mention. The bathroom especially the shower was gross with things rusted. I had to wear flip flops in it. The whole hotel needs major updating. Worse paint job ever. No wonder why the lobby is so dark as it covers it all up. We were all grossed out by this hotel. We didn’t complain because we were only there 12 hours and not worth the change in rooms. Don’t stay here. Be warned,8/20/19,1
"Hair left in shower, no toilet paper, and blood stains on our bedspread. We informed front desk - 5 hours later when we came back from our evening out, nothing had been done to correct the issues. UNACCEPTABLE!. When the finally moved us to another room, it was a queen room and not a king. We have stayed at The Row previously - it is not what it used to be. They have lost all their standards. Their housekeeping manager should be ashamed and embarrassed. ",8/19/19,1
"We want to tell the tourist to be carefull with the maids of that hotel. We talked with the Security Man of the hotel and he told us, that he was going to see the cameras of that floor, but he never solved us nothing, we are very angry with the personal of that hotel, because we lost our money and my husband watch and they did nothing for us ",8/19/19,3
"Good: --Staff was very nice and helpful. --Comfortable beds. --Central location. --Good food court in the hotel.Not good:--When you check in they'll tell you that there's a ""mandatory"" $40 per night fee for the gym and internet and we didn't use either one. --Rooms are VERY small. --One evening a few of us were quietly relaxing in some comfortable chairs overlooking the bar and they made us move because ""it was time to close off that area"" ",8/19/19,3
1-room too small2- no water no mini bar in the room3-not clean at all4-air conditioning have sound it won’t allow you to sleep5-the front desk should be clear concerning the 100$ incident that they took,8/19/19,2
"The location was great. Both Musicals we saw were just around the corner and you are within walking distance to the Subway. I liked that they checked your room key every night before you could get on the elevator. I always felt very safe. The room was so small you could not leave your suitcase open. It was okay for a girls weekend but would not have been a place for a romantic trip. The A/C did not work very well. Bed and pillows were okay. Bathroom was very small and no place to lay your stuff on. This was our second time to stay at The Row so we knew what we were getting. Again, it was okay for a girls weekend. ",8/19/19,4
"I have been in this hotel 3 times, once in winter and twice this month! So surprised about all those negative reviews ! I had a quick check in and a quick check out! The hotel is on the Musical District, close to Time Square, only 2 mmmm walking to 5th Avenue shopping and to The Ned and Hudson Yards shopping centre . Short distance to Central Park and close to 2 subway lines? What else do you want? A really competitive price, friendly staff and security at the lift area! First check I was on the 10th floor, queen room. Second check in even better 17th floor! If you want a room get 1700, I will definitely come back with my girlfriends . Thank you for the wonderful time and crazy NYC ",8/19/19,4
"Great location, easy walk to shows. This not a 5 star but very comfortable. We only used the room to shower, sleep and had breakfast. it’s not a resort. Good value for the money! We would stay here again ",8/19/19,4
We was waiting nearly 4 hours to check in when all we wanted to do was freshen up after our long flight we couldn’t even go to the toilets as you needed a key card!! I spoke to a few people on reception who didn’t really care! The bouncers on a night to the lifts were so rude too and you had to wait ages for a lift which felt like final destination episode! The hotel was a great location that’s why we picked in the first place and the room was cleaned nearly every day which was good! If you didn’t have to speak to anyone in the hotel it would have been great haha!,8/19/19,3
"The only positive thing I can say about the Row Hotel is the Position, very close to everything. On arrival we were greeted with rude grumpy staff, no friendly greeting like Welcome to New York City. This was our first trip to NY and we travel all over the world and have never come across such a bad reception. The rooms are so small, beds were comfortable I suppose that’s a plus, but bathroom was even smaller and weren’t cleaned. We were there for a week and had to ask them a couple of times if it was possible to clean our room properly, like vacuum and clean the bathroom, which it never got done. The Security at the lifts were unfriendly and outright rude as you tried to get into the lift. We never recommend this hotel to anyone and gave us a bad first impression on NY ",8/19/19,1
Hotel is located Great near the port authority station. Small room not arrange good with either mirror and no place for suitcase to have open. Gym was great to use daily. Check in process was not that professional,8/19/19,4
Nice Hotel for a short stay. Interesting idea for the restaurant (discovering different ypes of food) too bad the tables of said restaurant were not clean... Music too loud during breakfast A litlle bit disappointed by the choice of decoration (quite dark) Otherwise very well placed in the cit,8/18/19,3
Hotel location is just so convenient to everything around time square. Literally next to the majestic theatre and very close to frozen and lion king shows. Rooms are just on the small side but seem to be the case anywhere in the city. Subway system is so close that riding the subway to and from LGA airport was easy unless you haul big luggages as I saw some tourist struggling to get them thru the turnstiles.,8/18/19,4
Good place to go if you want to be by Times Square. Just one block away from most theaters. Many show available and this is a nice location. Not as expensive as those place on Broadway and Times Square,8/18/19,4
I had many issues in the room. the locks battery!! died I was out of the for over 40 minutes. than the air conditioner wasnt working 3 times I called just the next day somwone took care of it. and a morning no hot water. no one said I am sorry. at the end the reduced the invoice but to say I am sorry ans try to do it better would be apriciated. money is not everythin,8/18/19,3
We stayed at this hotel for two nights this week. The hotel is in a great location. You are close to the subway and all the action in Times Square which is a huge perk. The hotel does have an unpleasant smell in the lobby area as some other reviewers have mentioned. The halls are dark. The elevators can be very slow at times. We waited over 20 minutes one morning to go down and ended up taking the stairs 16 floors down. The rooms are a decent size but very basic and a little outdated. The bed was not comfortable at all as the springs could be felt through the sheets and I’m not a picky mattress person. The second morning we were there we woke up to no hot water but the issue was resolved pretty quickly and we were issued a resort fee credit for the inconvenience. All in all it isn’t a bad place to crash after a long day of sightseeing but you may find other options comfortable,8/17/19,3
It was nicer than I expected and very convenient to the show we were seeing. Made it easy to pop in to drop something off before dinner or change your shoes before trekking uptown for dessert. Super fast elevators got us up to the 17th floor and back down in a jiffy. Was also a decent value for New York,8/17/19,4
"This hotel is in a great location. 1 minute walk to Times Square. We were on the 3rd floor and was very noisy, all night long. The room was huge. Staff helpful. Clean.No tea or coffee making facilities in room. May have been available but didn’t ask. ",8/17/19,4
"Hotel is around the corner of Broadway and Times Square. Rooms are quite small but ok (travelling alone). Cleanliness is ok. Hotel is very busy with large groups of tourists (which is quite logical wrt the location). Breakfast: poor. You better go for breakfast around the corner. Value for money: ok, if compared to other hotels in the area. No feeling for hospitality at all ",8/17/19,3
"Only One block away from Times Square. We couldn't fit enough local activities in our short trip. Aside from a few minor things, we really enjoyed the stay at Row NYC. The staff was polite and helped us when needed. We loved that the hotel can hold on to your luggage before or after room check-in/out while you get a chance to explore the city ",8/15/19,4
"See my comments. I have stayed here many times, and I would have expected an increase in service by now. The people who work in the lobby need more training! The elevators are complex and not made for foreigners who don't speak English. Entry is almost impossible for handicapped people! ",8/15/19,3
"Smallest nyc hotel rooms, dirty rooms, felt more like a hostel. When you call the desk, they just pick up and hang up, or pick up and put you on hold. Elevator wasn’t working on one point so they had to take us down the service and pick up other floors on the way ",8/15/19,1
The hotel is so dated and dingy. The smell that lingered was at times worse than the subway. The hotel wifi was definitely questionable. Can't believe this was listed as a 4+ star hotel. It did not meet our standards. We would NOT ever recommend or return,8/15/19,1
* check in take a time I was in line for 25 mints .* No guest service or bellman to lead me to the room and no orientation done for the hotel * the room is nice and house keeping is very help full and she is perfect sorry I forget her nam,8/15/19,4
Staff could be more friendly especially with out of town guest. Check in process was very slow on a Sunday!! also the staff at check in counter should be addressing their problems away from the Guest not at the front desk area,8/15/19,3
"I booked my hotel through tripadvisor which I have always found to be a great service. Upon arriving to the hotel I found out that my reservation had been cancelled, they said it was because my card was declined. While I was at the hotel reception I called my card company and was informed that they charged me, then refunded my money. After informing the clerk of this, she who was unbelievably rude, told me the hotel was sold out and I would have to find somewhere else to stay. After this I asked to speak with a manager, because I knew they cancelled my reservation in order to charge someone else full price. At this point the clerk asked me to leave or she would call security, which was completely uncalled for. I travel weekly for business stay at countless high end hotels and have never had such a terrible experience. I travel to NYC 6 times a year for business and pleasure , this was my 11 year old daughters first trip and the one thing she has told everyone about her trip is how mean the lady at the hotel was. I never stay on Times Square when in NYC, but did so because of this being my daughter's first trip. We ended up staying at The Pod Hotel it was a completely different experience. The Pod isn't the type of hotel I usually stay at but the staff/service was as good or better than any I have experienced at 5star hotels. Pod went above and beyond, gave us a great room with an amazing view since it was my daughters first trip. Would highly recommend them to anyone traveling with children. Great job Pod Hotel! Row could learn a lot from you guys ",8/15/19,1
A very fine hotel in center of Manhattan.... perfect location for all kinds of travel activities.... stay here! Friendly and very efficient staff. Multiple elevators for quick access to and from guest rooms. Will definitely book this hotel again since it is so close to train station and also to so many places that are in walking distance.,8/14/19,5
Good location and reasonably priced rooms modern but barely anything works properly in there. When you check out they’ll charge you “extras” and tell you they’ll refund it but they don’t leaving you having to deal with your credit card company to get a refund. Nothing more than credit card frau,8/14/19,1
"You will not get money’s worth here. It’s debatable whether the location outweighs all the negative aspects of this hotel. It’s extremely outdated and in desperate need of investment. Rooms are extremely small with only enough space for one person to walk between furniture at a time. Mold on bathroom caulk, peeling wall paper, chipped furniture. All outlets are like placing your plug in an open window hoping it touches the sides to make a connection. How hard is it to replace a $1.50 outlet?! Staff are about as friendly as disgruntled postman. And my favorite part is the mysterious resort fee of $40/night. Trust me, there’s nothing about this place to make you feel like you’re in a resort. I’ve been to a dozen different hotels in midtown and this one is the worst ",8/14/19,1
"A clean, convenient, affordable spot right in midtown. Very satisfied. The room was perfect. Minimalistic but had everything I needed - TV, toiletries, hair dryer, ample charging ports, good lighting, and a great view of quintessential New York ",8/13/19,5
Housekeepers/room attendants have no sense of respect for guest's belongings. Staying for 5-6 nights but came back to the room at the end of each day to find our shoes all piled up in a mess and luggage on the floor flipped open. Rude and disappointing. Bathtub clogs with water at ankle level each time we take showers,8/13/19,2
"I am totally appreciate with Angela Fiqueroa as Room Attendant to my room for 4 nightGot my room always clean and things stay in the place where i left themOverall I got a good experience for staying in this hotel, near every tourism area! ",8/13/19,5
"I reserved a room for three nights in the first night was not pleasant due to stains on the wall and paint peeling off specially above the window area but the location of the hotel was great and the room view was good. The next morning I intended to cancel reservation, i spoke to a person by the name of Catherine and she was very professional and understanding . I did not cancel and was assigned to a better cleaner room. Katherine fixed the problem with professionalism and hospitality . Row hotel should take great care of Katherine. I’m sure she brings lots of business and keep business flow at the Manhattan location. ",8/12/19,3
We were able to check in early lobby is very nice. The girl who checked us in was very friendly and gave us some dinner suggestions. We had a king deluxe on floor 24. Room small but expect that in New York. It was clean and Ice machine worked on our floor so that was nice. Elevators were very fast. I like that security is there in evening so only people staying in hotel can go into elevators. I was worried with some reviews I read but did not have any issues and staff was nice/room clean.,8/12/19,4
"The Row is in a great location of one block from Times Square and in the heart of the Theater District. It's a wonderful and safe area, there are many restaurants and shops, and it's just the ideal place to stay. We had an easy check-in and were able to switch from a high floor room to something a bit lower. The room was the perfect size for the two of us, with a comfy bed, a nice TV and refillable bottles for the free water/ice dispenser down the hall. The bathroom was a nice size, and I was pleased to have a tub. It came in handy later after a long day of walking! The WiFi was great! I appreciated the security at the elevators, and when the evenings come on, they make sure everyone getting on the elevators has a key card. We couldn't beat the price and the accommodations and were very appreciative of the comfort. There was noise in the hallway at 6 a.m., but it's NYC, and it's noisy 24/7 outside, so we get that. All in all, it was a great stay, and we will return to the Row again ",8/12/19,5
"Very nice hotel, perfect location, price was good, right in the center of everything. I always love being in time square. We were able to walk to a lot of place and there were food places all around. I will be using this hotel as much as possible ",8/12/19,5
"This is where we stayed for 5 long nights....3 adults in a tiny room. Once we had our suit cases in the room, there was barely any walking space left. Very disappointed in this hotel. Location was great though ",8/12/19,2
"I hesitated to book this place because the reviews were either 1 star or 5 star. Lots of people complained about how small it was. Yes, the room was small, but it was perfect for me and my bestie on our girls weekend! Everything in NY was expensive so I wasn't surprised at the rate. What I didn't like, was that the rate changed per day of my stay. But like this: I wanted a sunday-sunday stay. The first three days are less expensive than the last three. But get this!! if you book the seven days you pay the most expensive room rate! I booked through air B&B. There was also a separate daily charge of 40$ too. I still don't know what this was actually for, but it added almost 20% to my week.The room was clean enough ( some dust bunnies behind the bed when I was looking for an outlet) but bed was comfy and all I needed was a place to sleep/shower/ and get ready for the day. I would stay again, but see if I could get the daily fee removed. Another note. the bus tours were good, but read the details before you buy it.. the guys work on commission and are about every 10 feet on every walkable surface! only one of the lines is a hop on hop off and the ""tours"" are only one time per day and at a specific time. the stature of Liberty is not an Ellis island tour either. So if you don't let the guy keep giving you a ""better""deal till you just buy it and make sure you plan the days so that you can get your moneys worth you will be good! Note: the tours start between 8-10 and I suggest you are at the stop about 30 minutes early to get a seat on the bus, so get your plan of the times you have and what you will get out of the tour before you buy it. If you want a bottle of wine walk out of the hotel and turn right and go down a few blocks and there is a grocery store with wine. The liquor store across the street is 3 themes the price of just a few blocks away. The elevator tip: you have to show your key to the guard before you have access to the lift, so please have it out and ready so you don't stand there digging through your purse while people are waiting behind you. you must punch the number in the key pad for your floor and get on the lift it tell you to get on! there are no numbers in the elevators ",8/12/19,4
New York is a very expensive city. It was a unique experience but not to repeat.The hotel is nothing special. served its purpose.On the first floors you hear all the noise from the street.I do not intend to go back there,8/11/19,3
"First time in NY and couldn’t have asked for a hotel in a better location, a few minutes from Times Square. The experience was made extra special by the fabulous service provided by Junior on reception. Treated like royalty ",8/11/19,4
"Room as small, even by NYC's standards. Check in staff did not tell use breakfast was included, so we missed out on that. Location was great, so if that's all you need, then this place will suffice. The hotel has a dark, industrial feel to it. It felt like an airport. We did enjoy the City Kitchen next door, even though we could have saved that money if we had been told breakfast was included.The unique elevator system was nice, where you choose your floor and then the elevator is assigned, and as a result, very fast and efficient ",8/11/19,3
"Loved this hotel, being right in the center of everything, the staff and especially our super spacious room and king size bed. Thanks for the great stay in New York City for our first time. Will definitely be back and will be referring everyone I know coming to New York to stay here. My room didn't have a view which I wasnt too fussed about and had a huge room compared to what I had heard other people say about room size when coming to New York. The room was clean and cleaned daily. Couldnt have picked a better place to stay. Walking distance to Times Square and all the major attractions. ",8/10/19,5
This hotel was in a perfect location just a few minutes from Times Square. Unfortuntaly this was probably the best thing about the hotel. Check in was quick and the reception area was very big with a decent bar inside. When we got to the room first impressions were that it was nice and clean. However I did feel that the room was probably the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in. For the price we can't really complain but I wouldn't stay here again. If you're looking for something cheap and in the middle of everything then it's not a bad shout,8/10/19,3
"Very disappointed, rooms not very clean! Bits of food left on the carpet, dust on the units. Room was so small, there was 3 of us in one room you couldnt swing a cat. Very busy hotel. But great location ",8/10/19,2
"Hotel sports wonderful location and amenities but very tiny rooms. We hardly had any space for luggage. The hotel-guest-only restrooms on the ground floor were super convenient. Security was only tolerable, as we spotted young men loitering the halls more than once. A good place to stay if priced reasonably ",8/10/19,5
"The location is fantastic and the mattress was comfy. And that’s where the good stuff ends. The hotel is dark and unwelcoming. The attitude of the staff is appalling - whilst I was treated with relative civility I watched the atrocious treatment of an Italian family checking in before me and still have not quite recovered from the fact that this could be considered good customer service. There is a deceptive compulsory package you have to buy for over €30 per day for services such as internet and phone .. but as it’s compulsory even if you don’t want the services - this is a deceitful way of forcing extra money from customers and then hiding behind the small print. The small and dank room was not clean to start and the daily clean was a joke - I ended up buying stuff and doing it myself - hair all over the place from previous residents, it was not vacuumed once during our 5 night stay, toiletries rarely topped up, surfaces dusty, the towels clearly had been washed cooked 100s of times previously ... and there was a lingering sewage smell in the room throughout. I have come to the conclusion that the dark styling throughout is simply a tactic to cover the dirt and staleness. I’ve read the hotel’s bland response to other poor reviews and just feel even more disappointed because the standard tepid response from management essentially reflects the poor attitude and quality of this hotel from start to finish. I write lots of reviews on TA and have traveled quite a bit of the world but this hotel tops it in terms of a poor experience. ",8/9/19,1
"Not bad for the price, location was good, service was great. We slept terrible because there aren't enough pillows. maybe we could have asked for more but we had a great stay either way! Thank you!!!! ",8/9/19,4
"I preface this by saying I’ve stayed in NY a number of times in various neighbourhoods, and I also read reviews. Both of which led me to think ROW would be a decent stay. I was very wrong. I’m not one to normally write bad reviews but I’m honestly so disappointed. The lobby floor was dirty when I checked in, the elevators also had garbage on the floors and smelt like a public washroom. The hallways are very dark. Unfortunately when I checked in I had to immediately run out, so I didn’t have a good look at the room otherwise I really would have immediately checked out and asked for a refund. At first glance the hotel looks cool but when you look a little closer you realize how cheap the finishings are and the total lack of care to little details from cleaning staff. My room was dirty and dingy, the electrical outlets quite literally have a layer of caked on dirt/dust on them, the bathroom wall has an orange stain in the wallpaper, there was long black hairs on the side of the bath tub and on the night stand, the iron did not work properly and leaked water all over my clothes, my door did not shut properly without having to force slam it shut, the blind shades on the window do not operate properly they appear broken as one side remains high while the other comes down. The bathtub needs to be scrubbed you can see the line of grime from previous uses along the bottom. There was dirty toilet paper in the toilet when I got to the room. The list goes on. I told a staff member in the lobby and they said they’d send someone up, no one ever came. Maybe this is a one-off bad experience, and I hope for other guests sake it was but for me to be paying almost $300CAD for that? I’m beyond disappointed. I checkout tomorrow: I normally never want to leave NY, now I can’t wait to get home. One night here was too much ",8/8/19,1
"My two nieces and I enjoyed an overnight stay while attending a broadway play. The location is great.. easy walking distance to Broadway and Times Square Very modern hotel and the lobby was very interesting. I did not give it a better review as the room was ridiculously small, even for big city standards, and the bathroom ceiling had mold. The bathroom could have had a better cleaning and was so small you could barely turn around. It was fine for one night but not any more than tha ",8/8/19,3
"The location is very close to theatres and Times Square. There are many restaurants in the Hotel and close to the Hotel. It is easy to get cabs in front of Hotel. When we were at Hotel on Saturday they closed the street in front of Hotel for a very long flee market and food vendors, which we enjoyed ",8/8/19,4
"We stayed two nights at the ROW in July. This was a quick weekend add on after a work trip. Here is a summary of the stay. Upon arrival you will need to take the stairs or elevator up to the second floor this is where the lobby is located. The lines to check in were not too long but the front desk agents were not efficient or friendly at all. This hotel is located one block form Times Square right in the heart of the Theater District. This hotel is full of tourists, do you would think the Front desk staff would be used to the guests. Not! Of all the hotels I have stayed (just look at my reviews), this has to be the hotel with the worst front desk customer service. They are just short with customers, don’t make eye contact and get frustrated when anyone has a question. Our room was ready at 3:45, we hard more than one agents say very loud, “check in time is 4 PM so your room may not be ready”. Geeze….. I think everyone knows the check in time, and one would assume that if you are 15 to 20 minutes before 4 PM your room is probably ready. Our room was on the 9th floor and upon entry we were surprised with the small size of the room. Queen bed with two very small night stands. Very small desk and extremely small closet. You cannot put luggage under the bed so we had to stand it behind the entry door. The bathroom is also extremely small but overall the room did work for a quick weekend trip. This is not the hotel to stay at if you are going to be in NYC for a week, you will not have enough storage area. For a quick weekend trip it is perfect. There is not coffee maker or refrigerator in the room. Downstairs next to the front desk there is a bar. Each morning they turn the bar into a light breakfast and coffee bar. Lots of pastry selections and full coffee and juice bar. The hotel is located one block from the subway, and one block from Times Square so you are close to all of the action. Overall the room worked for us, service is poor but the location is great ",8/7/19,3
"Stayed here in April 2019 for 3 nights for my daughters 16th birthday and have to say the location of the hotel is fantastic, easy walking distance to Times Square, Broadway etc. Hotel itself is lovely had everything we needed, staff was very polite and courteous and the food court was an added bonus when wanting to grab breakfast before heading out for the day.Yes the room didn’t have a massive wardrobe or tea / coffee making facilities but this was not an issue for us as we was hardly in our room and there was 1000s of places on the doorstep to purchase food and drink. Thank you for a perfect 1st time in NYC, currently just looking to book for next year ",8/7/19,4
Nice personnel. Good location. Small rooms with Minimal accommodations- awful breakfast. Ice was 5 floors up. Was expecting 2 beds- got 1 and needed to upgrade. $100. More per night for the most awful pull out couch! Like sleeping on the springs,8/7/19,2
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night due to a flight cancellation. The first room they sent us to smelled terrible. They then gave us another room which smelled a little better but the bathroom still smelled bad. The rooms and bathrooms are small, cramped, old and dim. We were expecting much more from a 4 star hotel and were very disappointed. The hotel itself doesn’t smell great, is dark and crowded with people constantly. ",8/7/19,2
"Small (as expected) but cute, clean room! Friendly & helpful staff! Super location! Water fountains didn’t work & wait (at times) for elevator was way too long! But I would definitely stay here again  ",8/7/19,4
"The first day I arrive at the hotel the person who receives me at the reception desk addresses me political issues of my country without me being interested in the conversation and practically forces me to stand there listening to their opinions.To make the matter more uncomfortable, when I left the hotel they did not inform me of additional charges and when checking the account statement of my credit card I find that the hotel charged my bill for a breakfast consumption that I did not request at any time and did not authorize . More than a week ago I made the claim and I have not received a response or refund ",8/7/19,2
"We just got back from 5 days in NYC, choosing to stay at Row NYC for our visit. The hotel had very comfortable beds and contemporary decor in the bedrooms. We picked this hotel based on it's location, one block off Times Square, and price, lower than many other hotels we looked at. I expected the rooms to be small (and they were very small) but didn't mind since we were staying busy and would only be at the hotel only to sleep. Sound familiar? We are pretty low maintenance family so I really didn't look too much into what was being offered aside from price and location. Lesson learned.The room amenities were poor, or rather non-existent . There was no coffee maker and no fridge. Additionally, there was no complimentary coffee in the hotel lobby and is customary for hotels that don't offer coffee makers in the room.... had to purchase at their city kitchen food court. Went there around 9:30pm on Friday night - it's advertised to be open until 11pm - and found it to be closing down. All the individual eateries were either closed or washing down their equipment. So now there's no coffee, no fridge, and no restaurant on the premises. Add on to that the soaps/shampoos offered were the lowest quality I might have ever seen, even at the tiniest highway motel. So the amenities stink but the bed was comfy. What else? The elevators took quite a while to move around but maybe they hotel was packed with people? Hard to tell. The Concierge needed to make a visit to charm school. She didn't even bother to look us in the face when we were standing at the desk asking for information on why the ""bonus coupons"" failed to work. She just said to go stand in line at registration....The ""bonus booking coupons"" were three extras that were offered at the time of booking as a thank-you for booking at RowNYC. Lots of hotels in NY offered the same thing. We picked three items (coupons for starbucks, dylan's candy bar and H&M) out of a dozen or more to choose from. When we went to use them though, we found that they didn't work at all. We were advised by the businesses that the hotels offer these coupons to lure guests but they were not actually negotiated with the stores and have no value. In short, the businesses wouldn't honor them because they were fake coupons. I stood in line at registration to find out what the story was and was told that they had never heard of this before but they would contact a manager and get back to me. No surprise, I haven't heard back from them even now.All this great service and amenities came with a daily $30 facilities fee (to pay for the 'free' wifi) too. Ugh.As the saying goes, ""caveat emptor/let the buyer beware"". Definitely applies to this place. Will not be going back again ",8/7/19,2
There should be a cofee maker and a fridge in the room.I just rescue the good location of the hotel.My family got intoxicated with food in the Chinatown and we were very complicated with the nutricional and hibration care without a frigobar .In a city where it is so hot there MUST be a frigobar in the room,8/6/19,3
"This was my first time staying at Row NYC. Location was great, near all major attractions and Time Square. However, the hotel has very outdated rooms, dirty carpets and bathrooms. They don't have anything but old full size beds, and the mattress is so low and near the ground. Don't think I will be staying there again ",8/6/19,3
Great location - clean room. We had a corner room with windows on two walls which was great. Check in was speedy. Room was quiet even while facing 8th Avenue. Will definitely use this hotel again. The elevator was fast and never a wait. Security was always right there,8/6/19,5
"Fun hotel, near everything! Loved the breakfast staff, always cheerful! Easy to get around everywhere. Walking distance to times square, central park, subway and broadway. Rooms are small but that is New York! ",8/6/19,4
Friends coming to town or girls trip away - The Row is convenient and has good food options plus clean rooms to make it easy. Yes you get the typical midtown checkin craziness but rooms are somewhat bigger than the teeny tiny rooms found in midtown and they have water bottle fill up locations on each floor,8/6/19,4
"Stayed here last month for a week. Lovely hotel and great location but rooms were so small. There were 4 of us sharing and there just wasn't any space for suitcases, let alone wardrobe space for 4 girls. Rang down and asked could we have a bigger room and were told there were none. Plus, the lifts were a bit of a pain. They went with the floor which is good but meant you could be waiting a long time especially if it was a busy time! We also inquired about a late check out the day before we left and were told to ring down in the morning which was fine. So, we rang just before 8am and were responded with a not so nice reply to say they were fully booked.. why could we not have just been told that the night before when we inquired? I wouldn't not recommend it but I personally wouldn't stay again.. ",8/6/19,3
"The lobby of the Row hotel is welcoming and the staff is wonderful. When you step off the elevator, you walk into a very dark, dimly lit hallway. The rooms are typical New York City size, however, the room darkening shades were just disgusting. They were filthy. The bathroom did not have enough towels for two people and around the tub was not clean. I do not have to stay at the best hotel in NYC, however, I do expect it to be clean. This hotel did not meet my standards for cleanliness and we checked out after the first night and went to another hotel which met my cleanliness expectations ",8/6/19,1
"Slightly disappointed with the room, thought the decoration would be better, looked like a bit of tlc was needed. The corridors were dimly lit especially in the lift area, not great if you had a slight vision impairment.On the plus side the beds were comfortable and clean which is what you needed after a long day sightseeing, after all we didn’t stay in the room long as there was too much to do ",8/6/19,3
"Six of us took Amtrak from Erie, PA to Penn Station. It took approx. 11 hours. ROW is a couple of blocks from this train station. As we walked out of Penn Station we were inindated with cab/Uber drivers. The first offered 15$ each to go 2 blocks!! (NOT)Anyhow, we really liked ROW. It was so convenient to lots of ( ""good stuff"") It's in Hells kitchen and the theater district, only a few blocks from Times Square. Subway to Ground Zero and Battery Park is minutes away with a no transfer ride, which took 20 minutes. ROW offers a complimentary breakfast which is healthy and satisfying. Their Consieres are superb, knowledgeable and friendly. One in particular""Yasmin"" was wonderful! ",8/6/19,4
"The location of this hotel was great. it was very reasonable and there was always someone in the lobby to help you with questions, directions, getting a cab, etc. I loved the little breakfast selections they had set up in the bar area every morning. That was so quick and easy when you had a busy day planned. We can't wait to come back ",8/5/19,5
Pros: close to time squareMany eateries around to have breakfastNo queue for going up to the room as there are Many elevators and very fast. Cons: Elevators had a bad smell like urine. The guy at storage room was not polite at all when begging for a tip.,8/5/19,3
"A looking good hotel with a very good location. 5 min walk to Times Square. The hotel and room was clean. In the hotel was restaurant “City Kitchen” and we had a lot of choice about different food. It was for breakfast, lunch and diner. ",8/5/19,4
Improve the room quality + doors. It looks lika horror movie. I tried to open door & it completely scuffed / ruined my shoes. The bathroom is far too small. The closet isnt even a closet...Add doors not a shower curtain =-,8/4/19,1
"We visit NYC regularly but this was our first and last stay here. On the positive: great location for theater and Times Square, bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. Negative: long line to check in with clerks who couldn’t care less. Extremely busy crowded lobby. Room was tiny and Spartan even by NYC standards. Toilet was in a recess where you had to back in to sit. ",8/4/19,2
"Proximity is everything, and this is right there in the heart of everything Broadway, times square, etc. It is not opulent and a place you'll stay in your room all day - go out to enjoy the city, it's RIGHT THERE! Then at the end of the day - sleep here. ",8/4/19,4
"The location of the hotel is great. the rooms and corridor in particular were very nice. You should definitely choose your trip to New York. the hotel staff are quite interested. There are many artistic objects, paintings and decor ",8/4/19,5
"I read many negative reviews before I booked this hotel but decided to give it the benefit of doubt. Mistake. Rudest check-in staff I have ever had the bad luck to come across. Horrible start to a much awaited holiday. Don't bother paying for an upgrade to a room with a 'city-view'. My city view was the rooftops of sides of buildings opposite. And ladies - bring your own mirror to use when applying makeup. Mirror in room and toilet has lousy lighting so if you want decent makeup - bring your own and place it on the noisy and filthy aircon in front of window, and do your make while you are perched on the corner of the bed. Throughout the night, the aircon would blast for 15-20 min then would go off completely for 15-20 min then you wake up either becos you are perspiring through your pjs, or the aircon suddenly comes awake and starts to work again like a truck, in the process of it, waking you up. So bring earplugs. Of cos we tried the thermostat but well...what can I say. Only saving grace is the free drinking water supply and hotel location - just around the corner from all the theatres - which was the main reason why I picked this hotel. Guess the staff know this and that's why they don't bother showing basic courtesy to guests. Thank goodness I could check out without having to communicate with one of them again. Going to New York again soon - but will definitely give this hotel a miss ",8/4/19,2
Throughly enjoyed the hotel. The hotel was perfectly located for everything we wanted to do. Room was as advertised and clean. Felt very comfortable during our stay. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to other,8/3/19,4
"This hotel was amazing The view was spectacular. Placed bang in the centre of Manhattan everything was in easy reach.The hop on hop off buses were good value but try barter for a lower price we got 3days for price of 2. The new york sightseeing pass purchased on line prior to the trip saves loads of money and you can go straight to the front of the line.We flew with united airlines and were treated great meals ,snacks and drinks were complimentary and also pillows blankets in sealed bags and free movies to watch all in all it was fantastic i would definitely go again and stay at row ny ",8/3/19,5
"After much deliberating upon the choice of hotel for 6 nights I booked this as it was recommended by a friend. I therefore didn’t read the online reviews.The location didn’t disappoint, it is so close to lots of metro stations (which we had 7 day passes for) and a short stroll to things like Bryant Park, the public Library and Grand Central Station. Yes Broadway and Time Square are also on your door step and if you want a lively area then this is perfect for you.All the hotel staff I spoke to were extremely pleasant. In particular Junior who allocated our room on the 17th floor with great views down to the Hudson River. When we arrived he gave us the most perfect welcome making us all laugh after a long and tiring journey from the UK. This made us all feel relaxed and checking in a pleasure. Angela (Figueroa) also lovely, couldn’t have been more helpful. She serviced our room (1701) throughout our stay. After long days sightseeing in the heat it was comforting to know that our room was going to be somewhere nice to go back too, shower and relax.I only booked a standard room which was a decent size with two double beds which I felt was adequate for me and my two children (aged 14 & 11). The drink pouches supplied were good to carry about in the heat and there was handy filling station on our floor. Not sure what I really expected from the room. Yes it was as described however the fittings/furnishings/decor could have been better and the air conditioning unit was loud we turned it off when we could but that really didn’t distract from enjoying our holiday. Overall we had a good stay ",8/2/19,4
A nice lobby with a cozy lounge But room service and reception should be more helpful ..No answers on the phone..The ice and water on each floor is a cool idea .. the hotel has a good location on the 5th avenue,8/2/19,4
"I liked the location, access, service and environment. It's close to everywhere, train, attractions, stores and good restaurants. Couple things to improve, but not bad. Do not bring food to fridge because not all the bedrooms has refrigerator, and if you need it you have to rent or use ice cubes ",8/1/19,5
There should be better places to stay on the same range of prices per room. This was my second time on the ROW hotel in the last 3 years and hasn’t improved really much. Probably this was my last stay at this hotel,8/1/19,3
The first room was not clean and had bad odor. I was able to get the room changed after going back to the front desk. The second room was better but still not what I expected for the price! Hallways are dark.,7/31/19,2
"I am a pilot and I’ve stayed in places all over the world for the past 20+ years for both business and pleasure. This is by far the worst experience I’ve ever had. After checking into this hotel I got in the elevator to go up to the room and there was a power outage. My family and I were stuck in the elevator for 30-45min before the power came back on and they were able to open the doors. There was this crazy dude from NJ in the same elevator as me screaming that there was an old lady (there was no old lady) in the elevator dying and they were still unable to open the doors. Finally after the doors opened I still couldn’t make it up to the floor of the room. When I said I was checking out, Owen informed me I would be refunded. I’ve tried several times along with my travel agent to contact the hotel about a refund and have been unsuccessful. Now here I am 20 days, ten calls, 3hrs of holding, and five emails later with only one email response and no resolution. The hotel actually had the nerve to cite the time frame of their refund policy on day 19 to my travel assistant. They also asked again for my booking and room number again, which I’ve sent 5 times to three different email addresses. The amount of manhours wasted just trying to get this resolved is absurd and it’s a till not resolved yet. You are better off sleeping in your car than staying here. I’m actually elevating this and requesting my agency to remove them as a hotel option. Stay away from this place at all cost ",7/31/19,1
"Brighten hallway lights. Someone could easily trip in the dark. Other than that It was a great place to stay close to Time Square. Having security in the lobby, especially at night was a great thing to see. There was a lot of traffic, lots of people coming in and out. Having someone watching by the doors was a very comforting ",7/31/19,5
The location of this hotel is excellent and the staff are very friendly but the cleanliness of the room left a lot to be desired. We were going to have breakfast at the hotel but it was so basic we didn’t bothe,7/31/19,2
"We booked 3 Deluxe King rooms (235 sf.) in advance directly with hotel. When I called a week before arrival to get all rooms on the same floor, without checking reservation, agent told us, ""Rooms are allocated based on availability"". I asked for a manager and was rudely told, ""I am the one and response will not change."" She hung up when I asked her name. Up on check in, all we got 3 small size (140 sf.) rooms on different floors ",7/31/19,3
"Big room, super comfortable beds! Perfect location! Ask for the river view rooms! Worth it!! Around the corner from Times Square, City Kitchen has a lot of food options for meals and all food is delicious! Thanks ROW Team especially Aleks! I will be back again and again and refer this wonderful hotel to everyone! ",7/31/19,5
"I traveled for business and the location is great in Times Square and close to the subway. I lifted the sheet upon checking in to check cleanliness and the mattress pad was covered w/various types of hair ALL over. The front desk was polite and apologized, checked me into a different room and gave me two drink tickets. The second room was no better if not worse. Again, various types of hair everywhere as if the mattress pads were never cleaned or changed. I told the front desk they don't have to keep switching rooms, just put clean linens on the bed (I was only staying one night on a business trip). Ana, the Manager of Housekeeping was nice and she made sure this was done. Despite the staff being friendly, I won't be staying at this hotel again. ",7/31/19,2
"Had problems connecting with wifi, but I believe it was the firewall in my machine. Otherwise, a good value and location. Had to see the desk at check out to correct a charge, but they handled it well. This is my second stay, and I would stay again ",7/31/19,3
There is a long list of reasons I would never book this hotel again - a few listed: 1. Got charged 587 for one night for what was called an executive suite - closet size two rooms - not worth the price 2. Dark and dingy 3. Extremely rude staff at the reception,7/30/19,1
"The hotel was very good, clean, stuff was friendly and helpful. Communication before arrival was excellent. Would stay here again. The location is very convenient. Only bad thing is paring is extremely expansive- would suggest discount for hotel guests ",7/30/19,5
We booked a room for Saturday July 27th and checkin was pretty late compared to other hotels starting at 4pm. The location was great because we went to see phantom of the opera. We got the champagne option but couldn’t even get it because I thought it was going to be delivered to the room. When I found out they had no room service we went down to the bar at 11:02 pm and the bar was completely closed. We weren’t able to get what we paid for and couldn’t get it the next day either. Also beware of this $40 amenities fee they charge on top of the room even if you don’t plan on using any of it. Your better off somewhere else,7/30/19,3
"What you can expect at ROW NYC is the following: 1) a clean and comfortable room with an amazing view (depending on your room of course) 2) having to wait in line for a long time to check in and check out (if you cannot use express check out. ROW NYC has no respect for their patron’s time. At the busiest times and with a very long line, they have the check in/out desk set up with between 6 to 8 workstations and only one person working. They do not care, nor respect, your time. 3) filthy elevators. For some reason, some patrons think it’s ok to drop your garbage on the elevator floor. The hotel also does not consider cleaning the elevators a priority so the garbage remains for way too long. 4) poor customer service. Do not call Guest Services. The name is deceiving because the only service they provide the guests is an extreme level of rudeness. 5) long wait times for the elevator. 6) a great location in the city. I had lived in Manhattan for several years so I know what is centrally located and this hotel is in a great location. There is one issue with the location that is a double edged sword: the good part is that you are within walking distance to all the theaters; the bad part is that you are within walking distance to all the theaters. What this means is that getting to the theater is easy but they tend to let out about the same times so you are walking in mobs of people in front and around the hotel at certain times every day ",7/30/19,1
"This was my second stay at ROW and I cannot recommend enough. The elevators are small and slow but the room, staff, service, amenities, and City Kitchen are great. I will definitely be returning this Fall. ",7/30/19,5
"For the cost of the room, I expected it to be clean and for the a/c to work properly. The bathroom walls and door were filthy. The tub lining was cracked and moldy. The a/c vent was full of dust. Poo ",7/30/19,2
"For the price and location, it's hard to do better. The room was NYC small, but the beds were comfy, and the view was terrific. The room was a little shabby, but clean and decent. The only issue we really had were the elevators either not functioning properly and just long waits for them. They offer $45/day parking a block or so away that was painless. Service at the desk was excellent ",7/29/19,4
I found this hotel was very clean and tidy. It is only a block off of Times Square. It is central to many of the Broadway shows. The staff was friendly and helpful. I am so glad I booked in at this hotel,7/29/19,4
This hotel has been updated and the rooms are interesting and quaint. My room had a great view of parts of the city and it was comfortable. I wasn't expecting a lot but was pleasantly surprised by the room. I advise to get a corner room which has a view of 8th avenue and Jersey,7/29/19,4
The location was great and close to so many establishments. When we checked in the staff was awesome and I like how security checked room keys at the elevator before letting anyone up. The rooms were clean and the beds very comfortable. Would definitely stay again when in NYC,7/29/19,4
"Slow old smelly lifts, overcrowded, long waiting for everything, internet is slow, you can hear everything from the other rooms. Coffee shop overpriced with not nice employees. The location is central but the rest is not worth it ",7/28/19,1
"Hotel was in a great location for using the subway, eating, and going to broadway shows. Room was ready before check-in time and was clean. Friendly and helpful staff. I would stay in this hotel again ",7/27/19,5
"Stayed 7 nights very small rooms,keys didn't work several times.The major issue with the hotel is staff aren't friendly and long wait to catch a lift. Think twice before you bookMy daughter just got back who travelled after us and recommended the Pearl she loved it ",7/27/19,3
"Enjoyed my stay in Manhattan. This hotel is well placed, really close to Timesquare. Subway just at the corner of hotel block. Rooms not so large, but it’s Manhattan !! Calm and quiet place. I would get back there. ",7/27/19,4
"If I had to compare this hotel to anything I would say it's like having a middle seat in the back of a big airplane. It will get you exactly where you are going, but you know that your trip could be more comfortable in another location. But who cares, you paid the ""Hot-Rate"" Right? The nightly price of this hotel shoots up red flags, since it is so much less expensive than other 4 star and even 3 star establishments in the city. These prices do not reflect the obligatory daily facility fee in excess of $40 per day. The hotel does not attempt to hide the fee, I knew i would be paying it before I arrived, but my biggest question is why? Yes, there is a fitness center, which I did not utilize, there is wifi, which i don't need, and our included collapsible water bottles were just clear solo cups. If i needed any of these things I would be happy to pay a la carte. This is one of a few hotels that does not offer complimentary wifi anyways. Also, it would be nice if there was at least a coffee station for guests, coffee is not included in the facility fee.The location of Row is perfect for anyone who wants to tour around the city. Times Square and Broadway shows are so close you can hear them. (The Majestic Theatre which run Phantom of the Opera is attached to the hotel) There are several subway stations close by and you can always easily get a cab. Check in was simple and efficient, we were even able to get our room ahead of the posted check-in time which was nice. I had no issues with the elevator systems like other reviews claim. It's a big building, you may have to wait a couple minutes to get an elevator car from time to time. I can tell that the building has been modified to add lots of extra rooms on each floor. There is a sea of doors, and it just doesn't look natural in the hallways. The dim lighting and dark gray walls do not help the situation. Rooms are tiny, and very little to them. You get a bed, small bathroom and desk with a rolling chair. Super basic. (again not quite 4 star) Shower water pressure is very low, and the tub is coated with one of those pre-made vinyl covers instead of being tiled. The room was also a little dirty, but it wasn't that bad. The bed is very comfortable and the shades black out all of the light, so it's easy to sleep in. I had no issues from city noise.All of the staff that I encountered at Row were very nice and accommodating. I was real happy with all of my encounters. This place is well run with a lot of great people working there. The hotel room itself is just not very good. I think a redesign of the room and some brighter hallways would make it a whole lot more cozy.If I had a choice between this and another hotel at the same prices in the future, I would probably go for the other option, but I would not avoid this hotel if i could get it much cheaper than different hotels in the area. Row gets the job done ",7/26/19,3
Overcrowded with long wait times for checkin  expect to wait 40-50 mins in line. There were no rooms available for early checkin before 4pm. Elevator was overcrowded and slow. Expect to wait at least 10 mins to get on. Customer service was poor. Wireless internet does not work even after calling guest services. Rooms need more cleaning and sink was clogged. Room card gets deactivated. This happened to me twice due to the poor quality of the room card. Customers are sent back to the front desk to change the room card for a new one. Lots of issue with this hotel and I will not recommend.,7/26/19,1
"We booked 3 rooms for 6 nights on a Buisiness trip spending over £4000. The description on their site envisaged the property as a cool boutique style in a good location.So location was good, rooms ok apart from sticky carpets. What we did not expect or understand was that this hotel has 1331 rooms with a large proportion of the lower floors were given over to social housing (housing the homeless) . The entrance has a feeling of a train station with thousands of people coming in and out all day long it really did not feel like a £220 a night hotel. Please don’t misinterpret my review as being biased against the homeless I really respect New York City governments work to help the homeless but I am sadden by the misrepresentation by both the hotels website and booking.com.I feel I was ripped off ",7/26/19,1
"We chose Row NYC off of Airbnb, and we were highly satisfied. The rooms were updated and modern, and the bed was extremely soft. The staff was super friendly and provided excellent customer service! The check in/check out process was so simple, and the location is perfect in relation to Times Square. I highly recommend you stay here ",7/26/19,5
"There is something going on on the 4th floor, found out it is being used to house the homeless now... read the articles. It's definitely an issue for ROW.. Many people coming and going between the 4th and 6th floor. Very strange. Elevators smelled like urine. Lobby smelled like urine. Elevators always were unclean and trash on the floor (sometimes kept that way all day). Staff was rude and unhelpful. No one seemed to really care. Not at all what we had experienced a couple of years ago. Will never go back there again ",7/25/19,1
"Stayed here on a weeknight for business, should have realized the price being half of that of other hotels in the area was indicative of the quality, but I booked last minute and didn’t do my research. First thing I noticed was how dimly lit the entire hotel was and there is good reason for that...so you don’t notice how dirty everything is. Checked in after 9pm and chaos ensued with throngs of people at the elevator bank all trying to get into one elevator at a time. Even with almost 10 elevators, their elevator assignment technology took me 25 minutes and 5 elevators to actually get in an elevator to my 9th floor room. When I asked about taking the stairs, I was told they were just for hotel employees. I was helped by a helpful employee to get into the elevator eventually which I appreciated. The room itself was bare bones basic and had carpet that was clearly not vacuumed and there were NO towels, not a wash cloth, not a hand towel and certainly no bath towels. There was only a bath mat hanging over the tub. The noise level was normal as expected in a busy Times Square hotel bustling with families, tourists and crying babies. The hallways were narrow and winding and dimly lit, which made me think it would be very hard to navigate in an emergency. Bottom line, staff was friendly, check in was speedy, but elevators system is flawed and rooms are dirty and not cleaned or stocked properly. ",7/25/19,2
Worked with me to fix probs of lost I’d and credit card. Very grateful for their help. I dropped my card on the floor in crowded lobby. Young lady supervising desk clerks came up to room and returned it to me after helping me solve missing I’d problem,7/25/19,4
"Great place to stay 2nd time staying at ROW and NOT disappointed. Close to everything, Staff were friendly, rooms clean and perfect size do not need any more room. Just sleeping there and going. Great sta ",7/25/19,5
"The hotel is in a great location, close to subway, theatres, Central Park, etc. Staff was very pleasant and helpful when needed. We had an issue with wet carpet from AC and they were very nice to give us another room. Lounge is nice and the City Kitchen is great to grab food/drink quick. Will stay again. ",7/25/19,4
"Nice Place to stay, will stay again. internet not the best but the site is a great location. Easy to get to almost anywhere in the lower manhattan area. The staff were friendly and had good information about the area ",7/24/19,4
"Hotel was very conveniently located near Times Square and concierge service was quite good. Ana was a gem and upgraded us to a nicer room. It was a long awaited getaway for us and this act of kindness meant a lot! Reviews are accurate when they say lines are long and place needs updating. It's nice enough, but misses the 4* star mark due to lack of upkeep. I would recommend for business trips where you're in and out, but not if you want to indulge for a nice long weekend. Overall quite pleased with our experience ",7/24/19,3
"very close to timesquare, easy to access and with all the transport means you need close to the hotel (newark airport express, uber, metro etc). the system for the elevators is very useful to go faster and not to stop at each floor ",7/24/19,4
If you are doing Broadway its hard to beat. The room price was just ok but fees ontop added $120 to the 1 nite stay. Rooms are outdated. Our A/C unit was so loud we checked out 7am as we could barely sleep and could not take it anymore. Our friend left 11pm for the same reasons and did not even stay overnight,7/24/19,2
Checking in lines are long. Everyone is told to come back after 4 pm. Need more front desk staff. Staff was pleasant despite the pressure. Single room is uncomfortably small. Bathroom door hits the bed. Climb around toilet to get into shower. You can't sit on the toilet without also being on the towel and toilet paper holders. Shower curtains too short so water ends up on the floor. The room was clean and bed comfortable,7/23/19,2
"This is our go-to place to stay when we want to visit NYC - relatively reasonably priced, very nice, good customer service, comfortable, fairly quiet and chill - just walk outside and you are right there ",7/23/19,4
"It was the worst experience I ever had in a hotel. Reception was rude when I asked for possibility of upgrade since the room they gave me was absolutely impossible: it looked like a closet literally next door to the elevator, so you can imagine the noise. The clerk said ""you paid standard, this is what you get"". Unbelievable bad service. I had packages delivered and they said would deliver to the room and never did so I had to come to pick it up but they still charge me for hosting the packages. Next day I spoke with the manager, and honestly, although she was polite she did not care. i was only one client in a sea of big groups. How come they allow a guest to stay in a room so small, noisy and next to the elevator? I do not recommend this hotel ever, it is located right on mid town but it is not worth it, Hated it, and I have stayed in many other hotels in NYC at similar level and above and by far this is the worst ",7/23/19,1
"Bad experience, very small rooms, very noisy, bad attention, bad service. Expensive for the location.It is not practical if you carry large suitcases. They charge you additional taxes.I would not stay there again ",7/22/19,2
"This is my second stay at this hotel. The price is excellent considering the facilities and location. The rooms are clean and spacious. You will find many people in the hotel, but it is a huge facility with many rooms. However, elevators are coordinated so as to allow access to your room as soon as possible ",7/22/19,5
"Great Location! It was perfect if you want to be close to Time Square, Broadway Theaters. Hop on and Hop off bus stops. There was a great market outside our hotel Saturday morning, not sure if its always there but it was nice having it ",7/22/19,4
"The hotel is excelent for na ordinary day but if something happen like the blackout nobody in the hotel knows what to do or say People stayed during long time in the elevator, nobody knew what was happening and we found people scared without hel ",7/21/19,3
"In the heart of the theater district, one block form Times Square. Fabulous location. The rooms are tiny and the elevators are confusing. The location makes up for the shortcomings. Decent restaurants on the property but better near by ",7/21/19,4
"NYC is an expensive place to stay, but Row NYC is great value and great location. Located on 8th Ave., right near Times Square, it's convenient for everything in midtown, close to entertainment and transportation. Rooms are clean and adequate for typical NYC stay: up early, out for the day, back to sleep – and repeat. If I have any complaints, it's the crowds. It can get busy at certain times of day around the elevators. Overall, this is a good choice for a budget traveller who wants a clean room in midtown ",7/21/19,3
"Book on line. Take the room upgrade option, it's a good value. Easy to get to JFK on the E subway or going to Penn and taking the LIRR. Easy to get to EWR going to Penn and taking NJ Transit. Easy to get downtown and cross town on the E subway. Wide range of restaurant options. The M District lobby lounge is a great place to unwind at the end of the day. Elevators above the 15th floor can get backed up at check out time in the morning ",7/20/19,5
Great location in Times Square - walking distance to everything. Rooms were okay however I was moved as I did not want a 'connecting' door room. The hotel had good food options with City Kitchen and District M downstairs. The lobby is modern and has a good vibe. The cleanliness was inconsistent - when I arrived the bathroom was still dirty from previous guests.,7/20/19,3
"Great location for Times Square and Broadway shows. A little far to subway but not bad. Bed is comfortable. A little dark in lobby, elevator and halls. Bathroom tiny and not as modern as I prefer. The maid service was fine. It is just old and you can tell it. Again for NYC hotel standards to price it is fine ",7/19/19,3
"Do not book! This hotel is like a hostel in a horror film! The rooms, hallways and elevators are not air conditioned. Heat stroke waiting to happen with Summers in the city. HOT!!! The double bed is more like an oversized single bed, good luck fitting two adults comfortably. The staff will ignore your requests, not recognize you with friendly manners and are the least helpful staff in the city ",7/19/19,1
This was by far a horrible experience and I would never suggest anyone stay here... overpriced rooms for undervalued customer service. The staff was rude and extremely disrespectful. One of the room service aides was arguing on her cell phone while cleaning rooms... service was abysma,7/19/19,1
"Very disappointed, paid a high rate, room was dirty and small, air conditioner was very noisy and also had an exhaust blower outside the window, very noisy 24/7 had to use earplugs to sleep, room was cleaned daily although not very good, carpet was sticky, plastic cups not replaced and dirt on floor in bathroom,elevators need to be controlled better as they are very small. Overall was very disappointed as the room rate was in high end. Paid for 4 star and received 1 star, to tip it off at the bar a Jamison on the rocks was $18 and a small beer was $8 overall worst hotel I have stayed in ",7/19/19,1
"I would like to highlight the wonderful help of the following staff members:Mr. Badoo, Ms. Cholong, Ms. Parizada (whom speaks Portuguese and Italian as well!!!) and Ms. Reina - they made our stay a true pleasure and I'd like to tell you to stay at their hotel any time of the year. You will not regret and have a good old time! :- ",7/19/19,5
"I’m disappointed so see some recent negative reviews, I stayed in Dec 2018. The staff were polite and helpful. The room was cleaned everyday. Excellent location! I’m looking forward to my next stay in Jan 2020 for my mums 60th : ",7/19/19,5
"I've been on Row for 14 years, since his name was Milford. Sempe was very well taken care of in the hotel, and I give a special compliment to Marcelo Del Col for the promptness, care, care and attention that has always answered me!Congratulations ",7/19/19,5
Need to pay attention to hotel maintenance. Emergency ysystems do not work and pose a high risk. The hotel's age is showing. Location in Manhattan is great and management shall pay attention to details,7/19/19,3
It was Terrible! The staff was unfriendly and not helpful! The elevator situation was ridiculous... over crowded and no air. Numerous request for extra pillows...fell asleep waiting on them to be brought to our room.,7/18/19,1
"I think they are very friendly and welcoming. Love their attitude and helpfuless! The room was clean, the check-out is easy, no sighs or bad attitude if there is an issue, they solve it and thats it. Perfect location as well. We will come back for sure. : ",7/18/19,5
Clean and Convinient for Tourists in the center of times square and al the broadway shows. Lots of food options nearby and yes make sure you go to John’s pizza restaurant next to the hotel and try their garloc bread you will love it,7/18/19,5
"This was my first time staying at Row NYC! The lobby was clean upon entering, everyone that worked there was extremely friendly! I was put in a room with a gorgeous view of the city! Overall the staff went above and beyond to make sure I had a pleasant stay! I will for sure be coming back ",7/17/19,5
Every things was top drawer. Professional staff. I had hoped that the hotel offered music as advertised but there was none. The elevator system was brilliant. It was easy to figure out which one to take. Be sure to check for your checking gift when you arrive.,7/17/19,5
This was horrible after the blackout there was no breakfast no gym no internet but they still charged for it all. How can you charge full price when half our day trip was spent outside the hotel with all our luggage!,7/17/19,1
The rooms are outdated. The staff was very rude and we weren't notified of the deposit that is due on top of the rest of our bill. Very unorganized. I do like that the security checks everyone's room key at night.,7/17/19,1
Hotel is conveniently located in Midtown Manhattan with a great view. It is priced fairly and has modern design. The elevators are fast as well. The room comes with 2 water bottle bags to tote around the city which was a very nice treat!,7/17/19,5
Stinky Lobby. Slow elevator. Like dormitory style. Worst customer service. Dirty. Expensive. Not worth your money. Go book your hotels other than this. So crowded. Literally crowded. Elevators stinks. Small elevators. Rooms are so small. 2star hotel rated,7/17/19,1
"I stay at the row NYC every year and have never been disappointed. It is close to everything I need, clean and helpful. I recommend the Row NYC to all my friends and family. Close to Broadway and all my favorite restaurants. ",7/17/19,5
I was forced to leave the hotel room I was in when I booked a second night no one would help me stay in the same room. I went to concierge and called front desk and no one helped me I had to check out and they ended up giving me a room right next to the room I was in the night before. I had two large bags and I had to lug them to my car in the garage and ended up driving around all day til I could check back in. I missed a matinee as a result. I was not happy,7/17/19,2
"First of all, I always seem to find good in all places....this was a tough one for me. I will say that the location was perfect. We were right in the heart of Time Square. I will start by saying that when I booked I specifically asked for early check in as we were going to be up at 3am and would be arriving by 10am. Upon check in I was told that I could not get a room until 4pm. I was a little put off but put our bags in the storage room and went to check out NYC. They had promised to email me when our room was ready. By 3:30pm I still hadn't heard from them and I was tired. I went to check to see if the room was available and it was (thanks for the email :/) The elevators were so tiny and so over crowded that it was ridiculous. We were on the 19th floor. I really did like the murals on the walls....kinda cool. The rooms were clean but ridiculously small. We were 3 people and it was a challenge. Our view was of a brick wall. The power went out (not their fault) but no one kept us informed about what we should do. We went down 19 flights of stairs. We got to the lobby which has only bleecher type seating to find out that there was no where to wait. The lobby is unwelcoming . Once the power was restored we climbed 19 flights of stairs (too big of a line up at the elevators).... again, not their fault. The room was only cleaned one of the days we were there. The cleaning staff never showed up to clean our room which lead to a lot of garbage and lack of paper products for the bathroom. This one surprised me because we spoke to the cleaning lady as we were leaving the hotel and she asked if she could go in. To sum up our visit, I love NYC and so we had a fantastic time. I would not stay at this hotel again for a few reasons. I did not find the staff friendly or particularly helpful. I am a good traveller and like to give good reviews so this one is hard for me. Not worth the money. I am in the service industry so I am very aware how important it is to have GREAT customer service. People can visit once but we want return customers. Unfortunately, I won't return to this hotel again. Aside from the elevators, most of these critics can be addressed ",7/17/19,2
"There was hair in bathtub, the shower head barely worked and I had to remove toilet paper from its holder in order to close bathroom door. The elevator smelled terrible (urine.) The room was clean and well appointed, but overall, this hotel had a very impersonal vibe ",7/17/19,2
"Not only were there no emergency lights on the 14th floor or the emergency staircase, no one handle the situation. Also, carpets were not clean, the bath leaked and the internet did not work throughout our stay ",7/17/19,2
"This hotel is rated four stars, but far from it in terms of service and standard. Always long lines to the reception and impossible to get service from unfriendly concierge. Rooms looks good in pics, but is more like a hostel standard. Not recommended. ",7/16/19,1
Great location..... price was very reasonable.....booked through Airbnb... I will continue to use Airbnb...... Row NYC was very clean and right around the corner to Times Square. I will definitely be coming back!!,7/16/19,5
"Had a great time in NYC, stayed four nights at ROW NYC in a King Size Bedroom, we were four including a Crib for our youngest. Typical NY hotel rooms size, but large enough. Price was good versus competiton. Very clean hotel, Staff was efficient even at busy times at check in and check out, rooms cleaned every morning. Security was present at all hours, which is nice in a busy area. Location is amazing, a block away from Times Sq., Subway is everywhere, PA Bus Terminal across the street. 15 minutes from Central Park, 15 minutes the other way to Empire State Bldg. We fully recommend. 5 Stars ",7/16/19,5
"Good for a short touristy trip. You will love the views at night, Good restaurants around the place.It is right next to times square, Broadway, madame tussauds and 15 min from central parkCheckin can be tedious and staff is a bit hostil ",7/16/19,4
"Good hotel! Great location, close to Times Square, Broadway shows, many restaurants, stores and public transit. The rooms are average but for the price I was more than happy! Junior who worked at the front desk was amazing! Very friendly to welcome you to the hotel and NewYork and very helpful to ensure we had the best check in ",7/16/19,4
"The ROW provided an excellent base for a three person trip to New York for a couple of days. Very reasonable price, good, clean rooms and overall facility. We didn't take advantage of the di ing choices, but all looked good. We will next time ",7/15/19,5
The bottom line is when you pay for something you should get what you pay for. We paid full price for a room three nights in a row and they did not come clean on the last day. We had to call back a total of four times to even get towels and washcloths sent to the room. No compensation or anything was even offered. And they still charged us for the full facility fee. Don’t be fooled by the flashing lights and close proximity to time square. It’s just not good. And they could care less,7/15/19,1
"We stayed here while J Lo was in town so options were probably limited. The location is good & we had no problem with Check-in or Check-out. The room was pretty compact with a very noisy air-conditioning unit. Hotel decor was average condition. Lobby always seemed busy. Biggest issue I had was the price of drinks from the bar, expensive even by NYC standards ",7/15/19,3
"the hotel is great not only for location but also for hoster name Junior. He is so generous and kind. We have a great vacation! The view in my room is also beautiful. This is locate in time square, so really convient ",7/15/19,5
"I stayed at this hotel, that is very creepy to start. The hallways are very dark, the rooms are tiny as is the bathroom and I got a view of nothing of value. Aside from that, upon arrival the staff were friendly and helpful and the location convenient in Times Square area. In room WiFi is hopelessly slow as is cell phone service. No room service, no coffee or tea in room.I went to the restaurant, which was fine, then went right to my room. A few minutes later the power blacked out for 2 hours. During this time there were zero warnings for the first 30 minutes. Then they announced on the intercom to only use the stairs. That was it. I called the concierge, to ask for help and was met with hostility. I asked if room service was available or if the restaurant was open, she said no and said I’d have to walk down 15 flights to get anything.At checkout, you would they woulda given everyone a second night or some kind of Apolog ",7/14/19,1
Good hotel. Great tromp l’oeil art. Pleasant room with shower AND tub. Great location for theater. Fairly efficient. Would return again and probably book directly. Good eating options nearby. Helpful desk staff and concierge,7/13/19,5
"My son and I have stayed in this hotel twice. We love the price and the location, so convenient to Times Square and Broadway. The staff is helpful and friendly. My only complaint (and I did not tell the hotel while we were there because it wasn’t a huge deal to me) would be the cleanliness. The sheets and toilets are clean — no issues there. But both times, we found other people’s items on the floor (a bobby pin, an earring), indicating that they don’t vacuum well. This time, there was also a single piece of dark (easy to see) hair left in the shower. Last year, we noticed that the alarm clock was in need of a dusting. Still, I would stay there again ",7/13/19,4
"Great check in, nice room, great location, right price. Perfect stay. The location is perfect for getting anywhere in manhattan. The rooms are clean a neat. The bar was friendly and nice, City Kitchen was amazing. What a great find in NYC ",7/12/19,5
Nice renovation from being The Milford. Good price - es0ecially hotel packages. Nice amenities - including Sugar Factory and City Kitchen. Great location. Recommend - especially if travelling with family,7/11/19,5
"The hotel is really nice close to everything rooms are a bit small , bathroom very small, I had a great stay at the row; my only issue is when my bill came & I was charged also $170 extra because I had packages delivered to the hotel, that was definitely a turn off ",7/11/19,4
"Speedy customer service. Small but very efficient and clean rooms, PERFECT location in midtown---you are close enough to Times Square but also close to the west side 'burbs' of HK so you can walk around there without feeling like it's a bottle neck. The elevators are a little odd ",7/11/19,4
"40$ per day for wifi which disconnected very often, TV France 24 not available but on the list, and many other things we did not need. In fact the price of the room was 210 instead of 170.In many other hotels in the world we always got the FREE wifi ",7/11/19,3
"Everything was great! Staff was very friendly and even got me in a room around 11 am despite the fact that they were full the night before! Room was clean and beds comfortable. 3 of us shared a room and we weren't overcrowded. Walking distance to so many places. Subway across the street, Times Square around the corner. Couldn't ask for a better location ",7/11/19,5
Check in was great. Kudos to Christina at front desk for check in who was absolutely amazing. Luggage storage and delivery was systematic and efficient. Overall a great value and location to downtown Manhattan.,7/10/19,4
"The hotel was within walking distance of Times Square, which was great if you're in town for a play. Junior and Douglas at the Check-in counter were amazing. They were so welcoming and had cheery smiles ",7/10/19,4
"Great location, clean room, but the aircon in the room was noisy as it turned on and off, and 3 of the 4 front desk staff ignored the people checking in - two were on their computers and one was scrolling on his mobile. When I finally approached the mobile phone user and asked if we could check in, he did. ",7/9/19,4
"First and foremost I am not a complainer, I am ok with a no frills hotel with the basics as long as it’s clean! This hotel is everything but that. The pictures make the rooms looks so much different in real life! These rooms are tiny. I mean, like so tiny that you have to walk sideways to get to the bed. Aside from that, it was filthy! The walls, chipped and broken furniture, carpets had stains all over it! The bathroom was so dirty I went to Duane reade and bought Lysol wipes to wipe the sink,Tub and handles. There were splat marks on the side of the tub that looked like poop or blood! Moldy mildew stains on the walls. Smudge marks on the headboard, just absolutely gross!!! The girls at check in were rude! Outside it doesn’t look so bad, and the lobby Itself also looks modern and well kept. Once you get upstairs it’s a whole different story! Dark dingy hallways and I felt very unsafe with my young daughter. Sketchy and shady!!! Spend the extra money and Stay somewhere else!! ",7/9/19,2
"Nice location, friendly staff, back yard view quiet room, very good internet speedA fridge and a boiler will be welcome in roomVery complicate to understand the billing of my stay (7 lines on my bank account ",7/9/19,4
I have stayed at the ROW NYC a number of times and will be sure to come back again! You can’t beat the location- right in the heart of it all! The staff is friendly and the breakfast crew is the best!,7/9/19,5
"Good Location and average service but there is a room for Improvement. Overall it is a typical city hotel with small standard rooms. I stayed here for 4 nights and on the second day of my stay probably 4 elevators out of the 6 went out of service. Another issue I had was with the elevator button on my floor, it gave people mild electric shock when you try to push/call the elevator to my floor. Hope you fix the electric shock issue soon Row NYC ",7/9/19,3
Old hotel but updated. Lobby & restaurant is great. The elevators are TERRIBLE! We were waiting 15 minutes one night to get up. They work differently. Couldn’t sit on the toilet either as box was in the way.,7/8/19,3
"We stayed for two nights, the best place for that kind of money on Manhattan. 5 minutes from Times Square, 15 minutes walk to the central park, a good view from the window. The room is not big but cozy, everything you need is there ",7/8/19,5
"Best location for a reasonable price. Absolutely loved the City Kitchen, amazing food!! The views from the room were amazing. And the staff was pleasant and professional. I felt safe and secure. Referring all my friends and family. ",7/8/19,4
The hotel was clean and located in heart of NYC. Easy access to all major attractions. But felt little discomfort staying with family as the rooms are small and congested. Could have been more spacious,7/8/19,3
Cristina T. Was very helpful at check in. She was able to upgrade our room from our online reservation and just very sweet!! Location in time square is awesome and price was great!! Pillow top bed was amazing!! Great night stay!,7/8/19,5
"We arrived at 1 plus in the afternoon. The hotel staff didn’t allow us to check in and told us to go back after 3.30 pm. Wonder why as shouldn’t check-in be 2 pm or 3 pm.We had to pushed our luggages to the baggage room which was on a different floor from the reception. We were made to pay tips for storing the luggage. We paid US$5. This was unnecessary as the hotel could have tried to give us a room if it was available. It seemed like they were trying to make us pay tips for storing our luggages. The hotel had a stench. Not sure if this is considered normal for NYC hotels. Security was tight only in the evening and one of the security guard was rather rude talking to hotel guests. Before I stayed in this hotel, my friend found on Google that it showed that the hotel is a homeless shelter. When I took a lift, someone who I saw on the streets earlier on entered the lift and went to Level 3. The room and bathroom are very small but clean. The location is good ",7/8/19,2
"Upon arrival we are greeted with the arrival of an ambulance this is going to be good. At check-in, I accidentally inter check-in wrong and get sternly told by the male staff I am on the wrong side of the line, but the marking for the entrance to check-in was not clearly marked. Check-in went well the ladies at the front desk were wonderful. Now with the hotel is located near many attractions and a short walk for shopping and food. The rooms are small the walls are thin I could hear the people in the next rooms conversations and the noise from the elevator was loud these rooms are non-smoking but you could smell cigarettes through the airconditioning system. And at times getting into the elevators was an adventure since some guest did not seem to know how to use the push the floor you're on feature to know which elevator to get on and they would get on the wrong elevator speaking of elevators they are small and cramp and when guest would get on the elevator with luggage this small space was even smaller. At one point I had to go and ask the housekeeping for toilet paper seeing that the roll was not replaced. And after reading the other reviews about free breakfast? What free breakfast at check-in we were never told about any free breakfast oh but I guess that is for the customers that booked with the hotel and not on a travel site. Checkout was quick with the key drop off, but what don't understand is the facility fee I was charged in all the places that I have stayed I have not been charged this fee before must be a New York thing. Would I stay here again no but if this hotel was booked for me because of work then yes  ",7/7/19,3
"Had a great experience at the Row hotel.A surprisingly quiet room with very comfortable beds.But it was the location that was so superb for us.If you are doing the broadway thing,this hotel is perfectly located. Also Times Square is just around the corner.Oh and the breakfast is well worth it,if thrown in with your booking ",7/7/19,4
"An old hotel that they have done their best to modernise. But, air conditioning is noisy and the location is also very noisy. Staff are pleasant and the rooms are well furnished. Bar is very expensive, didn’t eat in the hotel. Great location for time square especially if your visiting for gay pride. Lots of food places to eat of 8th Avenue. ",7/7/19,3
"If you want to get a taste of the culture of NYC, stay at ROW! My sister and I took a trip to NYC and had one of the best experiences here. Everything from the gift shop to the food court on the bottom floor was amazing. Couldn’t have asked for better ",7/7/19,5
"This hotel was just around the corner from Times Square. We could walk to many places reasonably. The bus, subway all nearby. Hotel was clean and comfortable, free breakfast was simple but delicious. Staff was friendly. ",7/7/19,4
"Convenient location near Whole Foods and Central Park, clean room, friendly staff, efficient and fashionable use of space, convenient check out. Check-in took a few minutes as there are usually lines ",7/6/19,5
Bed is like sleeping on a cloud. Room is small but clean! One block off time square. Staff is friendly and helpful. A nice quiet atmosphere. 24 hr store in Lobby. 2 restaurants attached. Bar and lounge for nite gatherings,7/5/19,4
This hotel was nice overall. The hotel accommodated us by allowing us to check in 3 hours early! Really helpful because we got to view the city without carrying around our bags. Cost was worth the quality of the room as well. Free breakfast and WiFi was a plus +++,7/5/19,5
"Fair price, but location is awesome! Breakfast is a good start. Near to subway station to get to Grand Central Station, 2 minutes walking distance to Times Square. Room was fairly clean but the room service and cleaning staff was very attentive. ",7/5/19,4
"I walked over to the Row after discovering that my husband redeemed with credit card points apparently didn’t believe in giving you the room you paid for (my room was supposed to be much larger and have a bigger bed) and didn’t believe in providing window coverings (the flimsy blinds blocked no light). Since I had stayed at the Row many times before, the front desk clerk offered to upgrade my room. It was comfortable and quiet: a long shelf for my luggage, a bench at the edge of the bed, and two sets of shades! Thank you so much for accommodating me, Row NYC! ",7/5/19,4
"If you want to experience the NYC that the worse criminal movies show, then come to Row NYC... If you want to feel like you will be raped and murdered in a hotel hallway, then come to Row NYC. Never felt to disgust and unsafe like in this hotel ",7/5/19,1
"We were extremely disappointed with this hotel. Customer service was poor, hallways were poorly lit, rooms were tiny and cramped and the staff here just didn’t seem interested in making people happy. We were denied a late check in even though travel delays prompted us to lose and entire day in the city. They just had no interest to go the extra mile to Row your boat in the right direction!! Worst hotel experience we’ve ever had in NY ",7/4/19,2
"The rooms look bigger in the pictures and the bathroom is very small, the knight that I stayed was the night of the gay pride parade and the hotel was crazy, trying to get on the elevator was not easy because it was so many people in the area and you pretty much had to push your way through to get on the elevator ",7/3/19,3
"Housekeeping staff were very friendly and nice! They took great care of us and the room was very clean. Hotel is in a great location at a good price. You can walk to so many theatres, Rockefeller Plaza and Madison Square Garde ",7/3/19,4
"My husband and I stayed here for a week just at the end of June 2019 after being recommended by one of my colleagues. The location of the hotel is fantastic - you literally walk around the block and you are right on Times Square and we were only 20 mins to Central Park walking and 20mins walking to Rockefella if even that. We were thrilled with the location. The room was impeccably clean which is one of my musts for a room - I hate dirty, mouldy bathrooms and this was certainly not either of those. Crisp white silicone and grout! Only down side was there was no ventilation extraction and unfortunately when we arrived it smelled a little damp due to others maybe not realising this, but after having the windows open as much as possible and certainly when we had a shower, the smelled disappeared. The room was bright as we had 2 windows with great views towards Times Square and the theatres (we did pay for this upgrade). Another negative about the room was the accoustics of the room - we had one of those adjoining door rooms so when the group of girls came in at 3.30am and then 6.30am, it sounded like there were talking in our room - thankfully they left after that night. But to reiterate accoustics - we could hear next door sneazing and their telly on in the mornings. It wasn't as frustrating as before, so we didn't complain about this after all.A final negative point about the hotel was the lifts as they had split allocation so that some only served half the floors and the others served the remainder - at peak times we worked out if we got the lift to the 14th floor instead we could get to our room quicker than waiting for our allocation of lifts to the 18th floor. We were waiting 20mins in a queue to even get in the lift one of the nights. I asked my colleague when she came back and she advised when she was there in winter the lifts were always there when they dialled in their floor number. I would say not to let the negatives I pointed out put you off this hotel though as it is great value for the location it is and we would still recommend it to anyone who was looking for a hotel in NY ",7/2/19,4
"My company used Row NYC for a trade show downtown. We reserved 5 rooms, with 2 of the guests coming back to me with complaints. Now, I book 100+ trade shows a year, and have never received complaints like this. One guest stepped on a large cockroach in their bathroom in the night. The other slipped in between the twin mattresses used as a ""king bed"" during the night. I know it's NYC and cockroaches are part of the population, but that's no excuse for a hotel. While the lobby and [some of] the rooms are nice, there's obviously a lot of updates that need to be made, especially for the price that's being charged per night. Unfortunately, we will not be staying with Row NYC again ",7/1/19,2
"Central location. However its just a bed and TV, bathroom and wifi. No refrig, no microwave, no coffee maker. wonderful bed but my husband and I could only get in BR one at a time. There is a bar downstairs and a fast food court. Also the conciege wasnt all that helpful .. she'd answer my question, but i found out she could have said more. No tips or suggestions. : ",6/30/19,4
"Good size rooms for two people. Good location,right round the corner from time square and a 20 minute walk from Penn station. The rooms were clean enough Would definitely stay again when in New York! Only down side out view was of a brick wall ",6/30/19,4
"Room was small and basic but also bright, clean & comfortable. Plenty of hot water for morning showers. The adjacent City Kitchen food court was a big hit with my teen grand-daughters. District was a nice spot for a nightcap and for above-average continental breakfast ",6/30/19,4
Great hotel in a great location! It was in the heart of Time Square and close to everything we wanted to see while in NY. We took our grandson to NY for the first time and he loved his stay. We will be back,6/30/19,5
"This was my 3rd stay at the row and it was still great!! Easy check in!! Junior on the front desk was soooo nice and helpful!! High floor, amazing view, clean, comfy and in the middle of everything!!! What more can you possibly want from city break!! When you are never in the room anyway expect to sleep!! The only issues we had was that only 2 elevators were working one morning but by the evening 3 were working! (Things happen and break) however they got them resolved ASAP!! I would definitely recommend and stay here again!! ",6/30/19,5
"This was the third time we stayed at the Row. Excellent location, clean rooms are small but more than adequate. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Luggage storage is available. Lobby has a small bar/restaurant that is perfect for grabbing breakfast or a drink and snack in the evening ",6/29/19,5
I've stayed at Milford Plaza many times. Was satisfied with it. The only good thing about Row was its location near to Times Square and walking distance from Penn Station. Blah blah blah blah blah blah. There's your 200 characters,6/29/19,2
I travel from Pittsburgh to New York City several times a year. And I always stay at same hotel. Highly recommend. Staff is friendly. Location to broadway theaters is great. Great bar across street. Great pizza one block down.,6/29/19,5
I had a terrible customer service experience! I wrote to the gm and did not get a response. His management team was clueless. Asked for his card and got a post it note with his name and email on it! Very unprofessiona,6/28/19,1
"Convenient location, decent sized room that needs a major update... elevator system is weird but I did not wait longer than 3 min....hallway dark and feel grungy....luggage stroing staff and housekeepong friendly annd helpful... front desk personnel a mixed bag... ",6/28/19,3
"- Position is very good.- My package was breakfast included but during my 1st breakfast, I discovered that not everything on the buffet was included (something needs ti be paid additionally). I was not aware by the hotel before.- Room was not well soundproofed: even if I was at 25th, I heard cars running.- Check-in and check-out were fast and easy ",6/27/19,3
"The location is great close to Time Square, Broadway and great restaurants. The employees are wonderful, very helpful. Would definitely stay again. The only drawback is the smell in lobby and elevators, need to clean more or use a cleaner with a more enjoyable fragrance. ",6/27/19,4
"The location of the hotel was great. It’s a 2 minute walk to Times Square, 8 minutes to Central Park. Subway is close by. The hotel elevators are extremely annoying. They are small, stuffy and take forever. Check in took a little while, check out was easy. The rooms get cleaned everyday which is good. The walls are paper thin, you can hear everything. Overall it wasn’t a bad experience, it’s pretty much what I expected for New York. Probably a little too expensive for what you get. ",6/27/19,3
"Our recent trip on june 24-27th was an overall good experience. We had an issue with one bellman being fairly rude to us but then another stepped in and more than made up for his poor attitude( the lovely bellmans name started with a b? Barnice?). We were thrilled toGet our room before 3pm! We had an issue with our card being charged twice by both hotwire and the hotel which we were told was an issue between the two of them. Kathy took very good care of us and the charge was sorted out immediately! Thank you to Barnice and Kathy! If it werent for you, we would not have had as enjoyable of a trip ",6/27/19,3
"It was my second experience in this hotel, and I would definitely stay there again. Very good location, close to attractions, theaters and train stations. The hotel connects to a food court that gives you discounts for being at the hotel ",6/27/19,5
"Location for sure, right in the center. We were lucky to get an upgrade to a larger room on the 27th floor. The view was beautiful, to the left water and to the right a peak of the Times Square sign. Personable and professional staff. We had a great time until my daughter fell ill, I was traveling alone with my 8 year old daughter. I added a night so had to re-activate my room keys, but my daughter still had a fever and a stomach bug. Housekeeping offered to sit with her while I ran down, I declined but how sweet of her to offer. When I added the night, it was again for the “standard rate” and remember I said I was upgraded at original checkin. My daughter was physically ill & with fever so they were kind enough to allow me the courtesy to stay in the same room without a surcharge. Classy Act, ROW NYC. I also phoned down to see if they could send up Children’s Tylenol, they said hotel policy did not allow that but they did send up a security guard to see if I needed anything else. Again, very thoughtful gesture of the hotel. I’ve read complaints about the hotel elevator system which made me want to research the hotel origins itself. Especially after experiencing the “wait” which now, I’m glad I did. After learning of the history, I honestly think the hotel should place a sign on each side of the elevators and “EMBRACE” the Art combination of past, present, future with their concept. The hotel opened in 1928, as The Hotel Lincoln, a year before the Great Depression. It was the largest hotel at that time. ",6/27/19,5
"This is the place to be if you want to be in the action of Times Square and the theatre; otherwise, find a place that is not as busy and where you can't hear the traffic. Junior, our front desk clerk, was amazing! We were granted late check out with no hassle and the housekeeping staff was so accommodating. Clean room and comfortable bed. Have stayed here twice and would stay again. ",6/26/19,4
"Row NYC has a lot going for it- convenient location to subways, AMTRAK, Port Authority, and theaters; friendly and helpful staff; comfortable rooms, reasonable prices, it is my favorite place to stay when visiting NYC ",6/26/19,5
Great location with easy access to the subway(literally 100 feet from the hotel entrance). Rooms are nicely appointed but small as you would expect in Manhattan. Housekeeping and baggage staff were great.. front desk was a little icy.. think they need more help. The place is hopping at night with free entertainment most nights that draws a good crowd. Would stay there agai,6/26/19,4
"ROW NYC was a great hotel! Brought my daughter to see Mean Girls on broadway Five minute walk to the theater and countless options for shopping, eating, and other activities within walking distance. We had more than enough to do in the area without venturing through the subway. Room was clean, decent view, I was able to check in early at 11am which was a plus! The girl at the front desk was super nice (wish I remembered her name) and very helpful. This will be the only hotel we stay at going forward. No complaints at all!!! ",6/26/19,5
"Don’t stay here!! I would love to say something positive because the staff at check in was so nice but it doesn’t make up for the deplorable cleaning standards and the dark depressing halls.The room was not clean at check in and after witnessing the house keeping lady cleaning our room I understood why. She literally never used a rag to wipe down the bathroom. She threw a chemical from a bucket into the bath tub and that was it. There was no wiping, no rinsing, nothing. Then onto the toilet. She sprayed the top and preceded to wipe it off with toilet paper. She did not lift the seat, nothing. I have never found a way to clean without rags in my own house, much less a space that multiple people are in and out of. She didn’t vacuum, was bothered when she had to do the bed and left without touching any floor space. While I discussed with a supervisor, another guest came out of his room and said his room was very dirty as well and had to clean the bathroom himself before feeling comfortable to use it. The hall carpet and carpet in the room is full of spots and filth. They need serious hall and elevator makeovers. The elevators all smell terrible and are also dark and depressing. This hotel needs help badly! It’s in a great location but there are many other options close by. I would never stay here again. Pictures are immediately following check in. Not what you expect after a room is clean for arrival ",6/26/19,1
Pro- Hotel is in good location. More affordable than most in times square. Cons- Rooms are tiny and older looking. Elevators were really slow. No closet at all to hang clothes. My bathtub faucet broke off when I first used it. (They did fix it right away),6/26/19,3
"What is great about this hotel is the location. Lifts are so damn slow, so small rooms and also noisy. They tell you its free wifi etc but then they charge you 40usd per night for hotel facilities without telling you ",6/26/19,3
Nice accommodations with ideal location for Times Square & theaters. I will definitely stay again. Good staff & very helpful. Cool bar & innovative cocktails. Great restaurants near by. Many close choices of places for breakfast,6/25/19,5
Row is a super trendy hotel right in the heart of Time Square. Considering it’s location we expected it to be loud but we’re pleasantly surprised by how quiet it was. It’s so close to absolutely everything! We walked everywhere! We also booked one of the Top View hop on/ hop off tours and the stop was only a 3 min walk from the hotel. The fitness room is really nice and the restaurants and cafes in the hotel are super convenient. The front desk staff were absolutely wonderful and went out of their way more then once to make sure our stay was more then perfect! The room keys double as luggage tags that you get to keep at the end of your stay which was awesome! The only minor complaint we had was the elevators. They are small and get very crowded and sometimes they missed our floor completely or took a really long time to get to us but other then that we loved Row,6/25/19,5
Dirty and smelly lobby. Terrible elevator system  elevator smelled. Poor and insensitive customer service!!! Front lobby manager and front desk clerk were seen laughing at a hotel guest after he complained about his room (guest had left the front desk area after complaining). They immediately stopped when they saw I was looking at them and was telling my husband what they had done. DON’T STAY HERE!!!,6/25/19,1
"It shows where the cafeteria come from, bad treatment, bad people, they are just dishwashers. I ask you to give courses of treatment and customer service to cafeteria staff and improve; not only the tips should move a good service, because although they were given the tip, they did not serve willingly, they are a disaste ",6/25/19,3
"Hotel staff friendly however, room accommodations very minimal. Conveniently located to theater and subway station. There was a long wait for elevators. Would have liked to have something to heat up water or make a cup of coffee ",6/25/19,3
Hallways and elevators need to be brightened and sanitized more often. More counter space for the bathroom is needed. No fridge or keurig or microwave either. Room itself was clean. Gym needs better ventilation,6/25/19,2
"I did my reservations at Hotels.com and as always, I have paid for it in advance. When I arrived at the hotel, surprise ! I was informed there was a mandatory extra fee of 40 dolllars a day for the use of internet (although I had free WIFI in my reservation), safe in the room and fitness center!!! I do not recommend this hotel, because you get all those items anywhere for free. The service was not good, very slow and crowded elevators, big lines everywhere.I will never come back ",6/25/19,1
Our shoebox of a room cost us over $400. Had my sister told me ahead of time I never would've went here. The pictures make the rooms look bigger than they are. If you don't mind wasting ALOT precious vacation time waiting for an elevator This is the place for you! Never EVER EVER have I had to wait anywhere from 10 to 25 minutes to get on an elevator! We got back to our room around midnight and the huge amount of people waiting for an elevator was like cattle in a box car. I'm not kidding! In the morning I swear I waited 25 minutes to just get out of the building. We were on the 19th floor. Never ever will I stay there again! no washcloths but there was a paper slid under the door in the middle of the night with additional fees on it amounting to $40+ more and we only stayed 1 night! Definitely felt robbed. Worst hotel experience in my life,6/24/19,1
"Still a great performer and a steady, reliable hotel. Front desk very responsive and offers to do more than asked. Rooms clean and sized for NY. Location just far enough from Times Square to be workable and near to alternative restaurants and services and entertainment including Theater Row. ",6/24/19,5
"I recently stayed at Row NYC on a business trip and it was a truly horrific experience. I have travelled extensively and stayed in hundreds of hotels around the world and the inconvenience experienced here was beyond anything I have experienced.The worst part of our stay was the AWFUL elevator situation.To enter the elevators, you need to punch your floor on a keypad in the elevator lobby and were told which elevator to enter A-H. The elevators were SO, SO backed up that it would take 10-15 minutes to get an elevator EVERY SINGLE TIME. People were packed like sardines in the elevator lobby while waiting for the TINY elevators to come and go, and guests were often VERY rude and VERY pushy because it was a desperate situation.The hotel is located in times square that is a traffic nightmare - I was here for a conference and my office booked it, or I would have immediately left. Coming to and from the hotel was a long process because of the unbearable traffic on this and the surrounding blocks that resulted in consistently high cab/ride share costs because it just took SO LONG to get in or out of the immediate area.My room faced a brick wall and was quiet, my coworker faced times square and had a TON of noise, even on the 16th floor. The rooms were fine; small but clean. Beds were fine, not good or bad - suitable. I would not recommend this to anyone - it was a very bad experience and I couldn't WAIT to not have to return to the property again ",6/23/19,2
"Location good, too bad they shuffled us to another hotel in a room that was not comparable. Cant really rate the hotel rooms but the level of service was not what we expected from an upscale hotel. The room we were provided free was a double bed, not the qeuu ",6/23/19,3
"After traveling nine hours I finally made it to the hotel, waited in line for a half hour to check in only to find that they had overbooked and I needed to walk to the new hotel they had reserved. Not a fan. ",6/23/19,1
"Reasonable and affordable, the hotel's location is excellent in the heart of Manhattan. Internet access is included, computer services are included, gym included very well.The hotel is close to the famous Broadway theaters, close to Times Square, close to the Port Authority bus station and more . To sum up the hotel is definitely reasonable ",6/22/19,3
"Good location, staff friendly and helpful (particularly Junior on check in) Arrived early and left our bags til check in & managed to get an early check in too. Room was clean, spacious & bed very comfy. No noise/ light issues - in fact we overslept! Good shower as well. Minutes walk from Time Square & plenty of bars/ restaurants nearby, Roxy’s deli/ restaurant & Smiths bar we’re both great & reasonably priced. Subway right on the corner as well ",6/22/19,4
I booked a reservation and had a change of plans and cancelled my reservation even though it was a week in advance . The representative stated that reservations cannot be cancelled and I am still responsible for payment in full. WOW!!! What a cancellation policy. I would encourage you not to stay at this hotel unless you are willing to eat your money if your plans change. I will not be booking at this hotel again.,6/22/19,1
The staff wasn’t very friendly. Only one person at the front desk while many people were waiting in line to be checked in. Overall my stay was very average. It wasn’t bad but it didn’t have anything that made is specially good. Just normal,6/22/19,3
"Great location, very friendly staff/employees, awesome customer service! Comfortable beds, nice bath/shower, great check-in and check-out service. Lots of restaurants and stores nearby. Definitely recommendable ",6/22/19,5
"Great location for Times square and centralized for seeing the popular attractions. Seeing a show or shopping, 9/11 memorial is a 7 stop ride on the subway. $3.00 ride. Parking is a 1 minute walk to the hotel ",6/22/19,4
"The hotel is ideal for all types of guests whether on business or leisure, single or family... it’s convenient location provides easy reach for transport, restaurants, broadway theatres, shopping & especially Times Squar ",6/21/19,4
"Had stayed here before, about 2 years ago and it was cool. This time, there were crowds waiting to get on elevators at every hour, requiring you to miss about 3 quickly-filled elevators before you could get on. One time, after pressing the elevator button to go downstairs, the screen kept saying ""No lift"" ( though one eventually came). Many guests were really seedy looking. In the room, there was black mold around the tub, the laminate on the furniture was chipped off in chunks, and the wall mural behind the bed was all scratched up. We were on floor 11 and heard sirens all night through closed windows. It seems like they have not maintained the hotel properly, and the lower prices are attracting a trashy clientele. Sadly, we will not be back.. ",6/21/19,2
"Hotel is smelly, staff is not really friendly, rooms are extremely small and not comfortable. My husband and I didn't like it at all, breakfast is horrible. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again, totally overprice ",6/21/19,2
"I don't want to give the impression that this is not a good hotel, but there are issues that may annoy. - It is well located close to all theatres, great selection of restaurants, main bus terminal, metro and shopping areas. We only had to walk around the corner to the theatre we attended one night and Times Square is within a short stroll. Rooms are comfortable and clean, but rather small. We also found the room very noisy day and night, from external sources, sounded like some kind of machine/airconditioning system. Front desk staff were professional and friendly but long check-in queues made it difficult if you just wanted to ask a question. One real issue which annoyed us was the wait for elevators, especially when going back to your room in the evening with large crowds and on a number of occasions staff had to ask people to move out of the elevator because it was overloaded. Also, each evening there were 'security' people asking to see your room card before you could go to the elevators and one particular fellow was quite 'agressive' in his approach. Rates are reasonable, location good but would we stay here again? Not sure....... ",6/20/19,3
"Well located hotel, crowded lobby, clean modern rooms, but short staff in front desk, long lines to check in. We had trouble with an unjustified extra charge in the credit card and had to complain twice in order to get a solution and compensation ",6/20/19,3
"We had our family reunion in New York this year and the ROW NYC was the perfect location to stay in New York and visit the entire city. The hotel is very cool and very modern and also clean and comfortable. At the same time it located in the middle of midtown at walking distance from many New York landmarks. The subway is also right below the hotel and we could easily reach lower Manhattan and other neighborhoods such as Chelsea, Soho and the Village. Great staff very friendly and helpful. We all had a great time in New York City ",6/20/19,5
"The hotel is an outstanding location, the front desk staff is the best I have ever seen, the hotel is clean and well maintained. The rooms are a bit small, but well put together, attractive and comfortable. You walk out the door and you are right in the middle of the action. We have been impressed with all the staff from the front desk to the breakfast crew to the cleaning staff. Everyone has a big hello and there is a feeling of a team effort. You can not go wrong with Row NY ",6/20/19,5
"It was my third time at the NYC Row and I'll recommend it again.It has a great relation between price and confort. It is a trendy hotel allied with great staff, great location and great variety of services ",6/20/19,5
"The hotel's location is perfect for theater lovers. At several theaters, I could easily have used the bathroom at my hotel during intermission. Plus, it's handy to a lot of good restaurants and the price is most affordable (for New York) ",6/19/19,5
Stayed here for 1 night on a business trip. This was my personal choice as I was coming in early for a mini vacation before a conference. Enjoyed it here more than at the other 2 major chain hotels I stayed at. Air conditioning was quiet. Room was fairly clean and modern. Though I did not love the bed it was ok. Global long distance included in service fee. Room is tiny but perfect for a solo Traveller or two of smaller stature. Ample storage room considering size. Very tall hotel and great views from upper floors. I did not pay extra for a good view and got one anyway. To be guaranteed a view it only cost a few dollars,6/19/19,5
"Cheap rate, but long lines to check in. Waited half an hour to check in. Took another half hour to get up in the elevator. Total chaos. The rate was good until I was hit with a $35 ""facility fee."" Total rip-off ",6/19/19,2
"The hotel was ok. Small rooms. Be careful of the 'hidden charges' I was charged US$278 AFTER we had completed our stay. When questioned, hotel reservations blamed everyone else because 'hotels in US charge these fees'. Then it was explained that these fees cover wifi, gym, etc; yet they clearly advertise complimentary wifi,etc! Further, the Reservation manager told me that I should have booked through the hotel direct, then I wouldn't have been charged these fees. So, what they are doing is creating a second room rate for people who get a good deal from agents. I say it is a rip-off! I will NEVER use this hotel again. You make your own mind up ",6/19/19,2
"We reserved a room on our way to the city for a one day trip. It was my brother and I and when we checked in, we requested a room with two beds only to be told that we had to upgrade to get two beds as it was “the last room”. We were told by Cesar we had to pay $30 for the “upgraded room”. I talked to my brother and we decided it wasn’t going to be with it and we said as long as it was a king bed we would be fine. Cesar pushes back and says we’re going to need to upgrade because the two of us won’t fit in the standard room but hell do us a favor and sell it for $15. We said no, and we’re assigned into a room that was smaller than 10x10 and sharing a wall with the elevator. When we came back down the other agent switched us to room 1647 and told cesar to update the reservation (so he could get his comission) the room was disgusting. Broken furniture. The carpets were very stained, the shade was stained black, the paint was chipping off the wall. We refused to stay. When we came back in the morning we were offered a refund of our resort fee and upgrade fee even though we didn’t sleep in the room. The front desk manager would go up with us she sent the housekeeping manager who agreed the room should have never been rented and took it out of service for deep cleaning and furniture maintenance. The front desk manager wouldn’t speak to us again. They know they were wrong and won’t respond. The front desk agent who helped us in the morning and the housekeeping manager were great but I doesn’t make up for the lack of response on behalf management. The front desk mananger said that if we would’ve checked out at midnight they could have cleaned the room and re rented it so we would’ve gotten a refund, however since we didn’t we were not eligible. The house keeping manager agreed the room the room should have been out of service to begin with and could not have been re rented. This was a waste of our night in New York paying for a hotel we didn’t even stay in ",6/18/19,1
"I really want to give an honest review, so going to try my best. There were definitely perks of this hotel but unfortunately some downsides that just made it hard to enjoy overall. The good:-1 block from Times Square. For the price, it’s the best deal in town if you want to be close to this area. We only had to walk to the end of the block to get to the theatre we were going to one night. -Room was clean, neat and all the staff were professional and friendly. -room darkening shades really helped. It’s noisy at all times of the day and night because of the location but the air conditioning was loud and gave a kind of white noise that actually helped a lot.The not so good:I’ve seen this on many reviews and had no idea what an issue it really would be: the elevators. Please, if you get stressed easily or are in a rush, just take the stairs. I get the point-there are 8 elevators and you enter your floor and it tells you which to go to. Problem is, they make multiple stops on floors to be efficient but it turns into a nightmare. I waited over 20 minutes one time as 3 elevators passed by me that were at capacity. I finally took the stairs which were creepy, kinda dark and scary. When we left, it took again 3 elevators to finally get one we’d fit in with our luggage. This hotel is just so big with so many floors, I get it’s probably just crowded however having stayed in many NYC hotels I have never had a stressful time just trying to come and go. ",6/18/19,3
"We stay at Row NYC 3 times a year for our family weekends in the city. Rooms are clean, hotel is great. Remember if you drive in....park at the ICON on 44th between 7th and 8th. Get your parking stub confirmed at the hotel and they give you a discount rate of $40 per day. short walk around the corner to the hotel.The concierge us always helpful ",6/18/19,5
"So, firstly, if you get Junior checking you in - you are lucky! He was absolutely amazing. The hotel is exactly what we needed, a clean room, clean bathroom, hot water and air con! The air con (as with them all) is quite loud if you have it on when sleeping. The bar downstairs is good, and has a good variety of alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks. So central to everything, so I would definitely stay here again. ",6/18/19,5
"After a long flight from the UK, we arrived at the row to be told that our Travel Agents had cancelled our booking! This was obviously quite worrying and after several phone calls to our TA it was sorted but this would not have been possible without Shantelle, who made us feel welcome, safe and made us smile. We had a great stay at the Row and this experience did not ruin our first visit to NYC. So thank you - excellent hotel, excellent location, we’ll be back! ",6/17/19,5
"I read reviews before coming and was a little worried honestly. When we arrived it was fine , check in was easy enough and the lifts worked fine. The lobby looked nice and modern however when we made it to the room I was a bit disappointed. The furniture was scratched, blind was dirty and so was the lamp. Most of the powerpoints did not work besides one so I couldn’t use the hair dryer or charge my phone on my side of the bed.The bath had chunks of paint and bits out of it and the plug was loosely in there. It looked dirty and staying here wasn’t cheap. However, besides the room we didn’t have any other issues. The hotel is in the heart if the city and the subway is just a walk away. If you’re not worried about cleanliness I would still stay however I think I would try somewhere a bit nicer next time‍♀ ",6/17/19,3
It's our 1st trip to NYC and staying at ROW is such a pleasant experience for us in terms of the room and how it is within walking distance to places we want to visit... Value for money and had made our trip enjoyabl,6/16/19,5
"My experience at The Row has been exemplary from the very start. I was checked in by Shantelle and she did an incredible job of making me feel both welcomed and appreciated as a customer, extremely polite, professional, and friendly. The room was spacious and quite clean. The location of the hotel is excellent as it is walking distance to many of the attractions people come to the city for. I will certainly be staying again thanks to Shantelle ",6/16/19,5
"I've been a loyal customer at this hotel for decades, going back deep into the Milford Plaza days. No more. A recent stay there was full of aggravations. First was the ""resort fee,"" $30 a day added to the bill for little more than wifi. Wifi is not much needed in NY with strong 4G and now 5G signals. And the hotel wifi was often so spotty that we turned it off and relied on cellular. Second, the music. You enter an elevator and it blasts at you. In one elevator ride we were accompanied by an African=American family with young children. The rap music playing included the N-word. Is there no sensitivity in this place? After a show, we stopped at District M for a drink and conversation about the show, But the music was so poundingly loud that conversation was not possible. Third, was guest services. One night we returned late from a play and found no towels in our room. I called guest services and they said they'd send some right up. None ever came, and when I called Guest Services 20 minutes later, there was no answer. There were no cups of any kind provided in our room. What has happened here? I miss my old friend in NYC ",6/16/19,2
The location is amazing. Center of Manhattan. Walking distance to any major attraction. But the service is one of the worst if not the worst i have ever faced and i am traveling a lot due to business. Small rooms with very basic amenities,6/14/19,2
"This was our second time staying at Row NYC and we will definitely be staying there again. Everything from the rooms to the location to the staff to the amenities is fantastic. The price is great too, especially for NYC. I couldn't recommend staying at Row NYC more! ",6/13/19,5
I wasnt expecting luxury but this hotel missed the mark on many basic levels. We had no soap in the bathroom. The room was insanely dark. The toilet wouldnt flush. Check in was a nightmare. Wont return,6/13/19,2
Overall I am very disappointed with the elevator because of the waiting time. Very crowded hotel. Employees are nice and friendly. Smells like cigarettes on our floor (17). The only good thing is that it's too close to everything and whatever you need is almost available close to the hotel,6/13/19,1
Super close to mostly anything you would want to see in NYC. I would way prefer glass glasses! And of course the plastic is so wasteful. But clean and efficient room. Great shower. We had a nice view of the wate,6/13/19,4
Some bad experiences and some good. Difficulties with check in. Difficulty communicating with staff at times. Overall I would not stay there again except it was so very convenient for us since our main reason was to go to Broadway Dance Center a few minutes away.,6/13/19,3
"I checked in very late, around midnight- the desk staff was very helpful and eager- surprising at that time of the night. i asked for 2 bottles of water and the girl was quick to get it from the back- complimentary. I had a quick, under 11hr stay but it was great all around. ",6/12/19,5
"Completely underwhelmed by this hotel. It’s in a convenient location near Times Square, but the room is tiny, it’s really old (step in the bathtub and you know it’s one of those cheap bath fitters put over something else because it bends and flexes beneath your feet), door frame looks like it’s been painted over 200 times. I wouldn’t have an issue with all of this were it not that it’s rated as a 4-star hotel AND it costs as much as a 4-star. I actually got my room on Hotwire at a “deal” for $200, but after taxes and fees AND a $40 facilities fee, it came to more like $300 for the night. I asked what was included in facilities fee: two cheap folding water bottles, access to gym, local/long distance and international calls, use of computers and printers. Oh and Wi-Fi. Well, just about every hotel in NYC offers gym, Wi-Fi and use of computers and printers. I wouldn’t mind the $300 if the rooms were fresher, but it felt like I was living in tenement housing. This should be rated a 2.5-star hotel and rooms should cost no more than $200 TOTAL. There should NOT be a facilities fee at all. Complete rip off and a way for the hotel to seem like a deal on Hotwire but they are actually sneaking a way to charge more. Sorry this hotel is NOT a resort. No reason to charge facility fee, which doesn’t even include breakfast. I only stayed there as a last resort because I had to stay an extra night in NYC for work. Even though my company paid for it I am upset because it’s such a blatant rip off. Good: it was clean and did not smell. Staff was very friendly Bad: overpriced, tiny, old room, what is that gross yellowish stuff dripping from the bathroom doorway? , cheap “renovation” of bathtu ",6/12/19,2
"Myself and my sister in law stayed at the Row NYC in May for 4 nights. The hotel is in a fantastic location, very close to Times Squaren and the Broadway theatre district and most attractions are a short walk away. We booked a double room and was offered an upgrade on our arrival to a twin room with double beds which we took. The room was great for our stay, had enough room for us both and our luggage and the beds were really comfortable. The housekeeping changed our beds and towels every day. There were no tea and coffee making facilities, but you can ask reception for a kettle which I did to have a cup of tea in the morning! The staff were friendly and accommodating as well. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel. We went to a lovely deli called Europan which was a short walk away that did lovely breakfast. A great hotel to choose for a city break to NYC, would definitely recommend ",6/12/19,5
"Perfect full-scale hotel in the heart of Times Square. I would stay again. All the amenities of a full-scale hotel. The live entertainment is a PLUS. Food court and sweet shop, plus plus. My only issue is that more front desk agents should be on duty to answer guests calls. It is very inconvenient having to get dressed and come to front desk in person ",6/12/19,4
The hotel it’s self needs a lot of work. The rooms are standard however the bathroom needs a new shower and toilet. The entertainment needs updating and the ceiling is too far down I felt suffocated.,6/11/19,1
"I usually always search and read reviews before booking a hotel. I made the mistake of not doing it this time and won’t make that mistake again.I’m going to start with a positive… -contrary to some reviews, I was fortunate that The staff was kind and professional with us.-it was perfectly located, practically behind the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. Walking distance to almost anything. That’s pretty much all the good I can say. My first impressions as I walked in or dirty stairs that took you to the second floor/lobby/check-in area. On our way to our assigned room, you are to mark the floor of your room. You are then assigned an elevator which probably doesn’t fit more than 4 people but get ready if more are assigned to the same elevator. The moment the elevator doors opened, it was like walking into a dark dungeon. Not a lot of lighting, dark murals, unkept halls with scratches and paint peeling off walls and doors. The room... I just had to include pictures because I still can’t believe a hotel, not a motel, was kept in such a manner. Doors were dirty. Bathroom wall filled with mold and not just a little bit. Stains on the ceiling that looked like urine. paint that was caked on for decades. There was even a hole in the bathroom that every time I looked at, I was expecting a critter to come out.I can keep going but I think I’ve gone a pretty good picture. To top things off, I should not have been surprised when I checked out and no one asked me how my stay was. I’m pretty sure they didn’t want to hear it ",6/11/19,1
"The room was not big enough to store two suitecases. It is really crowed in some moments but the location is good to visit the main points of interesting of Manhattan.The receptionist are very kind they solved immediately an issue with the first accomodation, when we arrived the room was not already and they gave immediately another accomodatio ",6/11/19,3
"I stayed in this hotel a few times and the only thing I could complain about is the size of the rooms and crowd waiting in front of elevators. Most of the times , I have felt like I was waiting for a bus or metro at a subway station. Location is great. Right at the heart of NYC , Times Square. If you are travelling single , it is not bad at all. Frankly speaking, if you ever stayed in Hotel Penn down the road , in Hotel Row it may feel like staying at Waldorf. Overall , it is a good hotel at a good price in the middle of Manhattan. What else can you expect more ? It is a good price/comfort ratio hotel ",6/10/19,3
"We had a very small bathroom with no privacy. The barn door style door left a foot wide gap so beware of that if sharing your room with a partner. We also paid an upgrade fee for a premium room but ours was rather small, I'd hate to see what we'd had if we didn't upgrade. ",6/10/19,2
"Overall our stay in The Row NYC wasn't a bad one. The room was quite small but had everything you need and as you spend most of your time out of it it didn't really matter. Good selection of discounts available as part of the resort fee, however we had to find these we weren't told. Lots of amenities and the location is perfect. Right next to time square and easy connections to lower Manhattan. Unfortuantly the one thing that did let our stay down was how rude the staff were. The second we arrived after getting stuck in ALOT of traffic (which we did expect) the staff pretty much just looked at us as if we were in their way. There was 1 person on the reception desk who wasnt particularly rushed to help any of the 6 people queuing for her. On the day we checked out the lady who took care of settling the bill was having her own conversation with a collegue right in front of me. I wouldn't have minded but they were talking about how irritating they thought the next person in line was going to be. Finally we asked another member of staff to use the toilet to freshen up before leaving for the airport as we were clearly soaked from the rain and were shouted at for needing a key to open the toilet, as if it were our fault it was locked? I just feel that the attitude of the staff throughout was lacking and whilst I appreciate the service industry is tough, for everyone to be so blunt and rude but then expect a tip, in my book is a little too far ",6/10/19,3
"Renovated classic hotel very close to Times Square within the theatre quarter. Highly recommended for theatre goers. Everything in Midtown Manhattan is reachable by foot, from 34th to 63rd street. Take high floor for a great view ",6/10/19,4
"Location, location, location - certainly for everything Broadway, but soooo big and busy. There are better and worst in the area and everything has its price. Registration and the elevator wait can be long. Security present. Room was a special handicapped room, as was the entire 'wing', so probably not typical and bigger than usual. Big bathroom too. Decent, but not great shower. The pipes were making beyond NY noise - feared they would explode every time I flushed, but everything held up. Bed was comfy, but not great. Street noise was OK and wifi fast and easy to use. Foodcourt in the hotel is a plus. I'd go back ",6/9/19,3
"Great location but check into all costs prior to booking. Bar tender in evening, friendly and efficient. Rooms small, but it is New York. Do not get the “continental breakfast”. Rip off. Plenty of restaurants near by with great food for the same price. ",6/9/19,3
"I booked a double bed CITY VIEW room for 2 people. When we checked in the receptionist (Paula I think her name was) told us she was moving us to a better room away from the elevators but this room had two single beds, I agreed as I thought she was doing us a favour moving us to a “better” room. When we got to the room the view was a brick wall.. I sent my boyfriend down to let her know we didn’t care if we were next to the elevators we just wanted the city views I had booked. He was greeted by a different receptionist who wouldn’t even look him in the eye and was picking at her nails. She was extremely rude to him and kept saying “two singles for two people, what’s the problem”. She called the manger over and it turns out they had over booked and there was no double bed city views available. We were never told this at check in and if we hadn’t complained we would have been paying the the city views price for a brick wall view. The manger (Irish man) was the only reasonable staff member. I then went down to reception to clarify a few things. We had to stay in the brick wall view room for the first night as nothing else was available but then remaining 7 we were upgraded to a superior room with city views. I agreed. We had to leave our bags at reception by 12pm and could check into our new room at 4pm. We had to explain the whole situation again to the receptionist in the morning. When we went to check in to the new room at 4pm we had to explain again to the male receptionist what was going on. I asked if we were definitely getting the city views that I was guaranteed. He replied extremely rudely “it’s better” and kind of shrugged his shoulders. The room did have some what city views. No employee once apologised for the mix up. Nobody said sorry once. Overall employees are so rude. I felt they were trying to take advantage of us because we are young. Other than that the hotel is nice and the location is really good. Would not recommend because there is just as good hotels with polite staff ",6/9/19,2
"I am currently staying here for work and I brought my family in for the weekend. I picked this hotel because of its convenient location to where I’m working. I paid for an extra day so that when I flew in on the red eye I could check in early in the morning. I called the night before I flew in to let the front desk know I still planned on checking in that day, but not until the wee hours of the morning. They assured me my room would be saved. I get to the hotel, and sure enough they gave my room away AND still charged me for the extra day. They were not apologetic in any way. My check in process took 45minutes. The whole reason I paid for an extra day was so that I could get to the hotel and check in after a long night of flying, and rest. My second day, I had a 2 hour break from my work hours and wanted to come take a nap in my room. About 20min after I got to my room, the cleaning staff knocked and offered to clean the room. I said I would be sleeping for a couple of hours so I would need to pass on turn down service for the day. The woman was gracious and said she could come back in two hours, no problem. I thanked her and went back to sleep. About 30min later another woman came by and offered to clean and I explained to her someone else would be back at 5 to clean. She said told me it would be easier for her to clean now. I said I wanted to sleep so no thank you. She peeked her head in the room and said we’ll just let me clean your bathroom and make your beds now so I don’t have to come back later. I became frustrated at her lack of accepting my no thank you, and I told her no one needs to come back and I didn’t want them down device anymore. She said “oh it’s ok I’ll just clean your bathroom” and pushed the door open as I was standing there, and made her way into the bathroom and quickly started picking up all my towels. I didn’t want to yell or say anything aggressive so I say on the bed and bit my tongue and she threw the towels in her cart and left. No goodbye. No actual cleaning was completed. I was floored. I went to the front desk (because I have still yet to have anyone pick up the phone when I call guest services) and waited in line for about 30minutes to speak to someone. I had now ran out of time and had to back to work. Every time I’ve gotten on the elevator I’ve heard others talking about how the customer service here is terrible and the rooms are not cleanly.I will not be returning to this hotel for any future stays, and I will not recommend this hotel to anyone ",6/7/19,1
There needs to be a new carpet. That’s my only suggestion. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. Loved the view. I wish the carpet would have been cleaner. I liked the location. The staff were very helpful.,6/7/19,4
"The ROW is fantastic! Keep in mind you are in New York so what you are getting is slightly small and cramped I will be honest. The location for starters is absolutely wonderful! Near subway stations, tons of food, lots of theatres and of course Times Square this is one of the most conveniently placed hotels in the city. Then you have the amazing food options in the hotels City Kitchen along with the bar, oh and sugar Factory next door. The convenience if the Row is amazing. Amazing customer service even on their bad days they will still do everything to help you ",6/7/19,5
The hotel was in a great location! The hotel was clean. The rooms were small but very clean and comfortable. The staff was helpful and friendly! City kitchen had a great variety of food that was delicious,6/6/19,5
"Small room, rude staff, no water heater , no cups, broken tv stand, the internet is always not working they kept on informing us that the manager is solving the issue! We always had to wait 5 to 15 mins to get the elevator! Gym is small but clean, they only have the basics which was fine...Great location, close to Times Square area and lot of good things around ",6/6/19,3
"I’ve just spent 3 nights here and I have mixed feelings about the place. First of all it’s neither luxurious and more like student digs. It’s my first time in NYC but have travelled all over the world and wouldn’t give it more than 2 stars. The room was nowhere as bad as I expected based on others reviews which was a relief. The room was clean although not spotless. We took ear plugs and we did need them because of aircon and outdoor fans etc. We slept very well and the bed was comfy which means a lot to me. The breakfast wasn’t worth having. We had no trouble at all with the lifts. We liked the vibe around the place. Check in was a breeze and the receptionist friendly enough. I did smell dope in the corridors and I do find the corridors dark and moody in a bad way, the whole place is rather tatty and battered. Would I stay again? Probably not ",6/6/19,3
"I will never return. Nice enough place for a inexpensive room, but, the $150 service fee makes the price outrageous. Nice staff but, service fee is disturbing. $150 for safe, internet, business center, etc is ridiculous. They should include all incidentals in the room price so there are no surprises. ",6/6/19,1
"Staff was decent, but room was dirty and smelled disgusting. Elevator was terrible and had to hold my breathe every time I was in it. Drain didn’t work in bathroom my first day. Would not recommend to my enemy ",6/5/19,1
"Good location and facility, especially for the price. Located convenient to Times Square, theaters, and lots of activity. Check in was efficient, and the room I got upgraded to (for free) was right on the corner of the building overlooking the the avenue. Glad I found it ",6/5/19,5
"The Row NYC is great for its central location you are literally in the middle of everything which is great.Our room was small but you only sleep there,it could of done with some touch ups like there was dust etc behind headboard and on skirting boards,there was a nic out of a draw,there wasn't a kettle in the room and the air con was quite loud. Breakfast was nice although there wasn't any information in the room about it so our 1st morning we picked up cereal and we're told we had to pay extra for that,although the pastries were very nice.The door staff never had a smile on their faces even if you spoke to them.We also had a problem with the room tax as they charged us $300 at the start of the holiday when we were told we would pay it at the end of the holiday and that it wouldn't cost that much (which it didn't in the end)Also make sure you ask the price of a taxi to where you want to go before you get in it as we were charged more than we were told. Overall we had a great week in New York and I would stay in the Row NYC again but I'm glad I know what to expect ",6/5/19,3
Row NYC (formerly the Milford Plaza) is an inexspensive (but nice) place to stay. The desk and/or door-folks are some of the most helpful people in the city. And it's a 1/2 a block from Sardi's. What more could you want if you are a theatre goer,6/5/19,4
"The lobby is beautiful! Then you get the elevators which is bad experience. We booked a Deluxe room expecting it to be clean, it was not and had really badly damaged furniture. We did complaint and it was swapped for a slightly better room although again it was not really clean either. The power kept tripping it was fixed each day however it kept happing so we found it hard to charge or phones etc, the water was brown on days and the level of cleaning at best was poor they even forgot to give us clean hand towels one day. I found the staff in the food market unhelpful and the same with the staff in the bar so I ended up going across the road to get coffee and breakfast. The only good thing I would say is the hotel in right in the centre of things so if you just want a bed for a few hours sleep it is ok ",6/5/19,1
"The only saving grace for this hotel is its location. Otherwise, there's nothing good to say abt this hotel. The elevator service is the worst. Can't believe there's an even more inefficient and ineffective way to program the elevators like this hotel does. Imagine you are at 16 floor and they just shut down the elevator on you at 7am! They have at least elevators but between 6-10am peak hours, only 1 elevator is working to service the whole hotel while the rest of the elevators sat idling around. Saving cost on your energy usage? The attitude of some of the front desk staff needs to be worked on. For some reasons, they thought they can be snobbish like the front desk staff working in a 5 stars hotel. Why is there a need to be snobbish in the first place ",6/5/19,1
"The Row is a very nice hotel just around the corner from Sardi's, Phantom of the Opera and Time Square. I like staying there to see a show, dinner and get back in a few steps. The people at the front desk are very considerate. The only thing I didn't like, is when you walk up the steps to the main lobby, it smells like pee ",6/4/19,4
"We stayed at Row NYC for 6 nights in May-it was a great place to stay, close to subway and all the theatres. Upon arrival, we received an upgraded room with a king bed and refrigerator at no charge. Many complained about the elevators, but honestly, it's a very efficient system. Select which floor you want to go to, it tells you which elevator you will get on. It only stops at the floors which have been called for-we had no issues. Breakfast is sufficient-everyone can have 2 eggs, and cereal or pastry, fruit, juice or water, coffee. Breakfast is supposed to be served beginning at 6:30, one morning it was not ready until 6:45, which delayed us a little. Otherwise-no complaints ",6/4/19,4
"A lot of people milling in or around the lobby, but have security guards to check room access. Room was standard, clean, bit small. Nothing really good or bad to say - not fancy but if you need a cheap place near the action this will d ",6/4/19,3
This smack in the heart of NYC. This is NOT posh like the NOBUs but it has great value for the price point. It is also close to the subway. The hotel and location are busy and super popular. The rooms are small but super clean. Welcome to NYC! The area is BUSY but the cool thing is in the weekends they shut the street down for a street market in the day! The staff are helpful and can't complete,6/4/19,5
This was our third stay at the Row. We liked the convenient location. This was our first visit late in May and we found the area to be very crowded. However the street market in front of the Row was good,6/4/19,3
The lobby is beautiful! Then you get the elevators and it is a miserable experience. Tons of us hotel patrons were stuck waiting for 10-15 minutes (sometimes more) at a time. We cheated the system and took an elevator to a random floor (because the door was actually open) and took the stairs the rest of the way to the 17th floor while carrying out suitcases! Absolutely ridiculous. The rooms are small and basic. VERY small. Not especially clean. We also found two gnats in the shower.,6/3/19,1
"A great location for basing yourself-few mins walk to Times Square and other great attractions like Broadways Shows etc. Port Authority a few blocks away. Numerous take away restaurants nearby with a variety of food.Had a room over looking the River. Room was extremely large and bed was so comfy :)Bathroom adequate size and water always warm. Ice and water machine just down the corridor.For such a large hotel, didn’t hear any noise from other guests coming or going and our room was near the lift. Also a bonus point-show your key fob to various attractions/restaurants nearby and get a discount :) Book you room now ",6/3/19,5
"Great hotel for price and location. Very friendly and professional staff! Row is my ""go to"" hotel when visiting New York City. Close to many restaurants, times square and the theater district. Taxis easily available too ",6/3/19,5
Perfect location near to Times Square and subway at not more than 100 metres from main entrance. From there you can explore this Big Apple just the way you want. Get overwhelmed by this metropole with Coney Island and Staten Island (to get some rest) easy to travel to within the hour! Central Park less than 15 minutes by foo,6/3/19,4
"Central location on 8th Avenue - Busy Hotel. Check in may take a while but worth the wait once in the Room, Excellent memory form mattress. This is a central location so expect the noise from the City Streets at night ",6/3/19,5
"This was our 2nd visit to New York, previously stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker, and have to say we much preferred The Row, check in was fast and friendly, reception area was unusual with loud music playing almost like a bar atmosphere for young cool people but I liked it!! and the lifts were good in the fact you tap in which floor and more or less takes you directly rather than stopping at each floor on way! We were on floor 15, we had 2 double beds in room as we were a family of 2 adults and 2 teenage daughters. Room was compact but for what we needed was adequate. I contacted the hotel before arrival as we had booked a single room for my mother-in-law on a different booking reference and asked if we could be close together, also that we were celebrating my husbands 40th birthday and our wedding anniversary. Our rooms were on the same floor, and my mother-in-law had a good view, ours was not as good but had a complimentary bottle of Prosecco which was a nice touch and very welcome after a long day of travelling. Each floor has a water/ice machine, we used it daily and hotel give you complimentary refillable water bottles. The room was quite noisy with traffic outside but to be honest the location of the hotel you expect it, and after busy days of exploring we still managed to sleep. Beds are comfy and rooms were clean. Would stay here again and would recommend. ",6/2/19,4
"Our stay at ROW NYC was great, the room was clean and tidy, the housekeeping did a very god job in cleaning our room everyday, the location was perfect and there were lots of food places nearby. The staff was nice and polite. Check in and check out were quick and smooth. We enjoyed every bit of our stay at ROW. We will definitely recommend it to our family and friends. ",6/1/19,5
"The location of the hotel was literally in the middle of time square, were right 5 mins from all the shows it was great. The rooms were a tad small with not all that many immunities but it was still quite nice. ",5/31/19,3
"Myself and my family (Husband and daughters aged 8 and 10) stayed in this motel for 8 nights. And let me qualify this by saying I have never left a bad review about anywhere i have stayed previously. Let me start with the good stuff. The housekeeping staff were friendly. And the food outlets that operate out of the same building were pretty good. That’s it. The rest is bad. So here goes!!!! We are a family of 4 and therefore had 4 suitcases. The room we had was not big enough for 4 people with hand luggage let alone 4 people with suitcases. It was tiny. For the price we paid it was a disgrace. There was no fridge and the phone didn’t work properly. And when you did try to use the phone not once was it ever answered by the concierge, reception, guest services... no one... ever. The rooms were not only tiny but dirty. And as nice as the housekeeping staff were the rooms were dirty. There was something brown splattered up the inside of the bathroom door that remained there the whole visit. I’m still unsure what it was. I’m glad I’m up to date with my shots!!! The reception staff were rude and the I’m pretty sure I knew more about New York than the concierge. We were given a bum steer on a number of occasions by them. From giving the wrong directions for subway stations to having no idea how to get to the airport or prices of such. The bell staff were argumentative. When I asked how long it would take to get to the airport I proceeded to be argued with about how I was going to get there. I just wanted to know what time I should get out of bed to get there in adequate time for my flight!!!! We were in a room next to a bunch of partying girls who constantly came home at 2 and 3am drunk and loud. And I am talking every night. The kids were woken every night. The walls were paper thin. We could hear every single word of their conversations!!!! I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone. It is severely overpriced. And don’t get me started about the “resort fee”. I pretty much paid $30 US dollars per day for wifi. They charge even higher than the telco’s!!!! We loved New York and it didn’t ruin our trip. Let’s be honest it would take a lot to ruin a trip to the big apple. However I am disappointed that I could’ve got somewhere way nicer for the money!! ",5/31/19,1
"It was an suprise trip, because there was an strike in Holland. When rebooked the flight from Chicago to Amsterdam, to Newark to Amsterdam..But this hotel is the best in NYC, all the hotspots are nearby.. We are like to come back later this year. September / October .. for 4 or 5 days.. we hope they are not too expensive then ; ",5/31/19,5
"This hotel is non other than what I call a ‘cat fish’! Booking this hotel I was so excited to arrive after seeing the ‘stunning photos’ online. After a long day of travelling and arriving in NYC we was so excited to see our hotel! When we pulled up in the taxi, the entrance was wow! Then that’s when it when down hill! We checked in fine then discovered they wanted us to pay a deposit in case we break anything in the room. Which is completely fair enough but when you see the photos of our rooms you will laugh. Cut a long story short I asked 4 TIMES to be moved. Every room and ‘upgrade’ got worse and worse. The rooms were tiny (a mouse could live there). The rooms were falling apart, I don’t think the hotel had been cleaned since it opened. We had blood on the sheets, toe nails on dressers, thick dust on the skirt and I can’t even begin to start on the bathrooms. I will just attach the photos. After getting the manager involved and said the next room we go to I want you to go there himself and approve of the room. The manager was not arsed and the reception lady’s were so rude. After many tears, they was absolutely useless. If it wasn’t for British Airways customer service our trip would of been ruined considering my best friend was proposing to his girlfriend out here! The hotel cost us a fortune which we was happy to pay for because we thought we was getting 4*! Basically I would not of let my dog stay in this hotel. It was vile. It smelt of weed the whole way through, people were smoking it was actually disgusting. This hotel is not 4**** I wouldn’t give it 1! Anyway after all of that we moved hotels and got a refund. Absolutely disgusting. Please do not book this hotel!! ",5/31/19,1
"This is simply a dreadful hotel. The fit out has been undertaken on a budget and include wall coverings with bright colours, cheap horrid carpet, old bathroom fittings recycled etc the shocking thing is they are advertising as a 4 star hotel. Surely this is mis selling. Hope everyone exposes this venue and stops the greedy owners from charging riddiculous sums for very poor facilities. On complaining the manager immediately agreed we could leave so don’t expect anyone to take any feedback constructively. Glad I’m switching to a real 5 star hotel today!! All customers should avoid this hotel! ",5/31/19,1
Great location if you want to be in the heart of Times Square. First night the fire alarm went off several times which was startling. They did refund us some on our first night's stay because of it which we appreciated. The rooms are very small but I've found that to be common in NYC,5/30/19,3
it's a great to be when you're on a budget. You can even do walk in reservation .. one of my friend didn't have time to book the day before but when we walked in. They were able to arrange a room for him on the same day. That was fantastic ! I'll definitely recommend that place,5/30/19,5
"We returned on 21st May 2019 from our second fabulous stay at the Row NYC, this time having brought along some more family members with us! We had 2 rooms, again on the 20th floor facing toward Times Square, and we had a lovely view of the lights atop of high-rise buildings and the glow from Times Square at night. Our particular room had 2 double beds to occupy the 3 of us (adults) and the space was more than adequate. Staff were friendly, as before. Location is perfect. We hope to return in the future! Thank you Row NYC! Gregory party ",5/30/19,5
"After admiting Row Hotel location is 5/5 in manhattan, my experience there was not that high ranked due, mostly, to the unprofessional treat I received from row receptionist team, in concrete, there was a very disappointing moment when I asked to a receptionist if he could make a call on our name to the taxi company to confirm a reservating and instead, he said: its out of my competence to do that. Do it by yourself. This portuguese receptionist, who was woring a pink shirt (to more details) was very unkind and unprofessional. We didnt like the checking process too, they were very unkind and didnt say welcome even! ",5/30/19,3
"Hotel is located in the heart of city near to all the point of attraction of NYC...great experience, good service and friendly staff made my stay comfortable... rooms were small but fulfil all the requirement of comfort. Thank u Row n Team ",5/30/19,3
If you want to stay on Times Square the ROW is a good an affordable option. The standard rooms are small. A queen bed is too small. Complementary breakfast is good but some more savoury options would be nice,5/29/19,4
"Very good hotel. Well spotted near the action, restaurant and barsWould go back there anytime.It is near the metroIt is near the bus that goes to the airport and you can take the hop on and hop off bus at the corner of the street. I will go back to this hote ",5/29/19,5
"We love this hotel! Perfect location to Times Square, hell’s kitchen, Broadway, high line, and Central Park. We travelled with two children and walked everywhere listed above. We’ve stayed here twice and will definitely stay again. ",5/29/19,5
"LONG BUT WORTH THE READ My friend and I decided to take a long weekend trip to NYC. We found Row NYC which looked nice to stay at. Had pretty okay reviews and the price was reasonable for times square. From the beginning I could never get anyone to pick up to phone, so I booked online. Everything I would call to ask a simple question I would be on hold for at minimum 10 minutes. I would even be sent to the wrong department, told that they “couldn’t transfer me to the right one and that i would have to call the number again”. I let this go since my questions were not too serious. On the day of arrival our flight landed early so I went to call the hotel to ask about early check in. I was on hold for the duration of our 1.5 hour drive, only to find out they could not tell me until I was there. So we get to the hotel, the line to check in was extremely long. And every computer had a worker behind it. Half of the workers were scrolling on the computers not helping anyone. We finally got through the line to be greeted by no smile or anything, not even eye contact. We were rudely told that check in was at 4 and I would get an email for my room number. My friend and I dropped our baggage off and explored the city. Once we came back to the hotel we were again waiting in a long line, half the workers not doing anything, and again rudely talked to. The guy wouldn’t even tell us our room number when I asked. I thought alright, maybe they’re all just having a tough day. Then you go the elevators. The absolute worst part about this hotel. You plug in your floor number and then are told which elevator to go to. There was not a single time that I waited less than ten minutes for an elevator. Since we were on the 20th floor that was not an option to really take the stairs. Although after a 45 minute wait we did resort to that once. Every single time you go to use an elevator there is a long wait, sometimes near an hour and half the time the elevators are too full that you have to wait for another one. After our twenty flight of stairs incident I went to talk to a manager. Waiting twenty minutes to talk to one, and a line was forming behind me to do the same. My friend and I had reservations so i could not wait any longer. I let it go, waiting for check out. The day we are set to leave we waiting 45 minutes for an elevator, two people before us waited an additional 20. I was furious and called the front desk from our room (the only way they will answer). After a few moments of talking to a manager he blindly transferred me to security. Literally did not say a word then all of a sudden security is helping me. I told security what was going on. They told me that the “elevators were down” I responded with so they’ve been down the last four days?? Yes, apparently they were. The last four days, which I don’t even think I believe. I was then given the option to use the stairs. I said I have a flight to catch and luggage with me, if I miss my flight are you guys paying for it? He then told me he couldn’t help me with that and transferred me to the front desk again. I then was waiting for five minutes until I decided to hang up and see the situation With the elevators outside our door. We then were greeted by security to give ya a ride on the service elevators. Thank goodness. But that was only a curtsy we were given after I had to complain to multiple people. I would have much rather stayed at somewhere else and paid double for better costumer service. I could not imagine staying with a family here. Staying with any kind of illness or pain. Or even if you’re prone to motion sickness since the elevators are so fast your ears pop and they go from floor 1 to 15 in a matter of three seconds. How the elevators are so fast yet are down? I don’t know. How the elevators are so fast yet take nearly an hour to get one? I don’t know. I will never stay at this location ever again. I will also be telling everyone I know who travels to New York about this terrible experience. ",5/29/19,1
"By now you have already read all about the location : It really is close to everything : if you’re going to the theatre it’s a couple blocks away , a very short walk to both Penn station and grand central ( I walked to both and enjoyed the nice walk , maybe a 15 min walk , I didn’t time it , ) close to Times Square , and if you’re cruising , close to the cruise terminal as well . So enough about location . As far as reviews about how small the rooms are : it’s New York ! Who is staying in their room , and if you’re not on a budget go book yourself a penthouse then . Rooms are respectable size for a very short stay and mine was immaculate ! Another thing that is very important to me is comfort after all that walking and touring and the bed was super comfortable . I was on the 24 th floor and couldn’t believe how quiet it was ! “ sally “ was my host and housekeeping was top notch . I also received water pouches to refill for travel as well as a coffee cup . May I add that the coffee at the lobby bar is delicious ! And while I’m not a breakfast eater anything you want is right there in their lobby “ courtyard “ of food: pizza , doughnuts , Chinese , Mexican . There is also a bar for a nightcap right in the lobby .A great view and a plus to have lots of outlets available to charge your phone while having coffee ( also lots of outlets in the room ) . The ONLY negative at all I would say is waiting for the elevator . If you’re on a deadline to get somewhere leave 15 min for elevator time . Keep in mind I guess you’re going to wait anywhere you go ! ( I’ve found the same wait at the marquis and much more congested !) But that’s New York ! Don’t let a wait for an elevator ruin your vacation ! I’ve already booked a stay again next month . ",5/29/19,5
"Although it has a great location, the elevator sistem is kind of frustrating. Didn't enjoy waiting 5+ minutes for the elevator to then have to squeeze in with 7 others strangers or let it pass and wait for the other when there were like 6 other elevators not been used at the time. The sistem could improve ",5/29/19,3
"Check In was very smooth, our room was ready early. The elevator system is very congested, but I knew what to expect since I read previous reviews. The room is small, but larger than what I was expecting. The standard room has a closet, iron, ironing board, safe, hangers, etc. Rooms were clean, but very outdated. We forgot our toothbrushes, but the front desk was very kind in accommodating that need. The beds are very comfy, but the pillows are a little flat. We didn't have a city view room, so our view was just a brick wall. We had the complimentary breakfast, the croissants were DELICIOUS! We enjoyed the cappuccino and juice as well. Douglas was very helpful at check out and Juan P. was helpful on our last morning as we were scrambling to get breakfast earlier than they opened (I'm 6 months pregnant). :) The lady at the concierge desk was very kind and helpful in booking us our explorer pass.If you don't want to deal with the elevator line, we noticed that rooms on the 1st-15th floor used the right side elevators and there was hardly a line. Location was extremely convenient to everything ",5/28/19,4
"Great convenient location in the heart of Midtown. I was lucky enough to have a corner room with both a fantastic view up 8th Ave and across to the river. The stand out for me was the staff . They were very helpful, a very friendly greeting and helped out with a late checkout ",5/28/19,5
"If you are planning a trip centered around Broadway shows, then this is the place for you. We saw 3 shows in 2 days and our longest trek was 5 blocks. ROW NYC is so close to all of the action and only one block from Times Square. You just can't get any closer for the value of this hotel. We arrived really early and Marcel was extremely helpful and gave us a pleasant welcome after an early morning trip. He was very helpful as we knew the room wouldn't be ready, but we were able to check our luggage and go out for breakfast and see the sights before our first show. Very nice to start the trip off with a good check-in experience. A bad one can set the tone for your whole trip sometimes. Yes rooms are not huge but who stays in their rooms when in NYC. Rooms are clean and comfy beds so you are good to go!!! Our only issue was the fire alarm went off three times during the night. All false alarms but a rude awakening to say the least. Never heard why they went off. Give it a try, you won't regret it...unless you are use to the Waldorf! Also beware of the RESORT FEE if you book the hotel on a site other than their site. Can add up if you are staying a week ",5/28/19,4
Convenient location. Room design is simple and cool. Good security at night by checking room card before enter lift lobby. City kitchen food hall right underneath hotel is also convenient esp. if you arrive late at night (it close at 11pm,5/27/19,4
"If we had not located the service elevators, we would have spent over half our vacation waiting for an elevator to our room. The staff was fully aware of the issue and no one offered customers a discount or anything. A few of the staff were sympathetic to the problem so they didn't mind us and other customers using the service elevator. But others were extremely rude about it. The after 6pm security at the elevators were so rude about it. We complained to every single staff member we came into contact with.We took the option of applying for early check in, which we never received. You could say well it isn't guaranteed, which is true; however, come to find out from staff that the week was entirely fully booked so there was no way we would have gotten early check in - then why offer it and waste my time! Our room was tidy, but they clearly do not do any sort of deep cleaning in the rooms because you can see the dirt build up on the edges of the room on the floor. Very weirdly, we also never got wash cloths - we had to ask for them to be sent up.Our room was very old and honestly just felt like a hole in the wall - felt like we were just shoved in some corner of the hotel - was awfully small. Also, it was May - the temperatures for the week were listed as high 70s and one day was 89 degrees, but we get to our room and they left the window ajar and no AC on - like are you kidding me! Why would you do that?! Overall the experience here was incredibly awful and I wouldn't suggest anyone stay here for any length of time. We stayed for 5 nights/6 days, which is a good chunk of change and length of time and the experience didn't warrant the money spent ",5/27/19,1
"I was over charged for the room. When you arrive and check in, demand that they give you your receipt. Make sure you are paying the rate offered when you do your booking online. If you can book with Expedia or any other travel online service, they are honest. ",5/26/19,2
"This was a horrible experience due to a middle of the night evacuation followed by an 8a false alarm. Management acted like the guests were an imposition when requesting information/updates, and wanting to return to their rooms. No consideration (credit, financial, future discount, etc.) for this horrible experience, not even an apology (not even an acknowledgement by the staff at the time of checkout). I understand that fires happen, but this could not have been handled more poorly. The staff do not understand the concept of customer service ",5/26/19,1
"So this was our 1st time at Row and cannot be any happier. Location at 8th Ave is the best and the most convenient. Front desk staffs especially the staff who greeted us was top notch. The elevator lady helps guests with pushing floor numbers. Upon entering the room, the city view was breath taking. Row gave away 2 travel water pouches. For a city hotel, Row is as great as one can get. The room was neat, not as spacious as other non- city hotels of course but still comfortable and very clean. The price was fairly reasonable. You won’t be disappointed staying here. ",5/26/19,5
"This hotel, described as 4 star presented me with a room with less than 11 inches of space between a double bed and the wall. The desk was barely large enough to accommodate my computer and the only seating was a hassock with no back support. The elevator service was totally inadequate with waits of 10 minutes not unusual. Virtually all individuals checking out before me had problems with their bills. The closet could not accommodate a men's 38 Short raincoat without wrinkling the hem because it was not tall enough. Hallways were dark and attempts at decoration with shrink wrapped walls looked not like art but rather disorderly street scenes ",5/26/19,1
"There is a place in New York where I feel like I were home. This is Row Hotel.I really appreciate the location, it is close to everything. Wherever you have to go you’ll find your train a step away.I want to say thank you to Parizida who was so welcoming with me during the check-in. We had a nice small chat about Italian wines.A special thanks to Maurizio and Thomas for being such a great managers. —-/-Sono estremamente soddisfatta del mio soggiorno in questo hotel. Tornare al Row è un po’ come tornare a casa. La posizione è formidabile. Consiglio questo albergo anche per lunghi soggiorni di lavoro. Grazie a tutto lo staff, in particolare a Parizada e ai due direttori che rendono speciale questo posto: Maurizio e Thomas.Grazi ",5/25/19,5
"This hotel is very big. The lobby is huge, yet inviting. People at Reception are very friendly, efficient and helpful, especially Junior who checked me in and was charming and welcoming, The room was lovely and being on a high floor, had a great view. District M, the bar in the lobby, served a nice breakfast in the morning, and all the staff here were very pleasant, both in the a.m. and in the evenings for cocktails. Love the atmosphere.The only negative was on several occasions, the elevators were slow and waiting was up to 10 minutes. Thanks to Junior, Marcelo and Yara at the front desk and Juan P., Kelly and Jarred at District M. I hope to come back again soon to the ROW NYC ",5/25/19,4
"The hotel is worn and old, I accept that there are older hotels but they need to upkeep and maintain, especially if they are a high traffic hotel. The Row NYC was poorly maintained and dirty, the hallways were dirty the rooms were not properly cleaned, our room had dust every where on furniture in bathroom and it was not hidden dust it was clearly visible. I reported this to hotel in first 24 hours when the sent me email requesting feedback. I stayed for 7 days the housekeeper vacuumed the room once, the sheets had holes. I am not sure who rates the hotel but they are not randomly checking rooms. The windows did not seal which gave us a lovely whistling when the wind picked up! The only 4 star part of hotel was lobby. If I was paying half the price and the hotel was listed as 2-2.5 star I would not have a complaint, but it is falsely advertised as 4 star ",5/25/19,1
"I have rarely experienced greater frustration with a hotel. From the moment I arrived, the staff was inefficient and rude. The greatest source of frustration was the frustration going to or from the room in the elevator. It was sometimes over 20 minutes to try to get up or down. Between the ineffective system and crowds - they only had two working - for a 27 floor building. On day two at the hotel, after getting to my room after dinner - neither room key worked. Going through the extended time to get back - again, the staff was rude, with no apology. The internet was so bad, it ripped you every few minutes. The hotel is expensive and downright horrible ",5/24/19,1
I was given a wheelchair accessible room which was quiet and very spacious. Room was clean every evening when I was back from work and the views were jaw dropping from the 27th floor. Powerful and not so noisy air-conditioner coupled with motorized blinds was a surprise. The door locking mechanism was not very user-friendly but it worked okay with some care. A care package with goodies like water bottle and mug were given which was nice. I was also given a breakfast voucher that included a small pastry and a coffee. The manager was nice as well. Self checkout using the iPad did not work. Very pleased overall and will return,5/24/19,5
"Friendly staff and great location, but the hotel itself left a lot to be desired. The room is tiny, like all NYC hotels, so that didn't bother me, but if you aren't used to that or aware of it, try not to be surprised. The internet went in and out by the minute, literally. I could not get any work done, and I was on a business trip. Then no one answered the front desk when I tried to call 4 times to find out what was going on. I would have gone downstairs, but it was taking me about 10 minutes just to get to the lobby from the 28th floor because the elevators were so slow. The hot water took about 20 minutes to actually get hot. But they have fabric shower curtains, and you can't reposition the shower head, so I caused a huge flood in the bathroom. Not a big deal, just inconvenient and time-wasting. Also, my room phone would only work on speaker. Again, not a huge issue, but frustrating. The room was clean and had great AC, so that was important. ",5/24/19,3
"Great midtown location - theaters, Times Square & Hell's Kitchen nearby. Subway (A C E) on corner. Penn Station (MSG above!) 1 stop. Fair value, clean property w/smaller rooms (It's NYC, get out of your room!). Multiple onsite food options makes breakfast pkg optional. Dining onsite and nearby excellent - short walk to Times Square ",5/23/19,4
"So the location of this hotel cannot be beaten in my opinion. You’re right by time square , Central Park is 10min walk to your right and and Empire State are 10min walk to the left . The hotel lobby is very nice and you think wow this is a nice hotel ! But then you get to your room. Very very small and dingy. The decor tries to be modern and minimalistic I think ? But it’s just cold and not welcoming at all. We got upgraded to premium city view which made it bearable. There is no complimentary coffee which I’ve had in every hotel I’ve ever stayed in New York either , something that small makes a big difference. Like I said location wise and for a couple of nights then yes it’ll do you . Would I stay here again ? No I wouldn’t ",5/23/19,3
"Great location, cool vibe, comfortable rooms -and bed! - and friendly staff. Subway station right next corner. Many restaurant options nearby and pretty close to the new hot neighborhood, Hudson Yards. Overall great value for our 4-day stay. ",5/23/19,4
"Theatre, restaurants, Times Square, subway, and taxis are right there! Clean and good room. Bed is a little soft and room a little tight. But good value for money. Did not try the breakfast nor use any other facilities. ",5/22/19,5
"Rooms are too small, Poor noise isolation between rooms, long waiting line for elevators, poor breakfast, one day My room wasn’t cleaned up. Fire alarm was on at highest floor in the middle of the night and announces were made through in-bedroom loudspeakers just to say “do Nothing”.... what was the point ay 2am? Twice ",5/22/19,2
"I travel to Manhattan (Midtown) often for work, and have been trying several hotels in the area to find one I like. This place is at the bottom of the list! Although the photos look pretty good online, don't be fooled - the rooms are small, dingy, and the finishes are really cheap (the closet ""door"" is a shiny polyester curtain that reminds me of one's first student apartment). The lobby is nicely designed, but is very busy and feels a bit like a nightclub with loud music and lots of neon lights. My colleague's room didn't have a shower curtain. Another colleague's AC didn't work. Another was given the wrong room # / key and walked in on a women drying her laundry on the air conditioner. Additionally, the tiny elevators often required a 10 min wait (sometimes, we took the stairs 15 floors down if the elevators were too full and we could not get on). The vibe here is super touristy and tacky and there seemed to be lots of 'characters' milling around the lobby (likely why security needs to see your room key before you go to elevator bank!) ",5/22/19,2
"The location of this hotel is simply perfect! We stayed there for four nights and it was pretty great. The rooms are small but that’s common in NYC. I highly recommend it. There were a couple of situations that were not that good, on Thursday night the fire alarm went on twice. The first time we weren’t there. The second time it went on we left the room as quickly as we could. I asked a housekeeping lady where the emergency stairs were and she told she could not give thar information, which kind of shocked me since she works at the hotel. We found the stairs, went down, waited for a couple of hours and finally got back to our room.The other thing, on Saturday the elevators were not working that well. There was only 1 and it took us a while to get it. Apart from those two things, it was a great stay at a pretty nice hotel. The room keys are great!! ",5/22/19,4
"Very clean and comfortable right in mid town. Close to everything. Walk to time square, Empire State Building and much more. Short walk to subway for easy access to all attractions. I would stay here again ",5/22/19,4
"I stayed May 12 paid on Priceline in full gave front desk my credit card which they over charged by over $1,500 I have called no response no call back ! Horrible service and criminals over charging I will never stay here again and no one should ",5/21/19,1
"Great location, clean rooms and good service. Many great restaurants, shops, entertainment facilities in close proximity. Good internet connection. Pleasant and helpful staff. Walking access to some major New York attractions ",5/21/19,4
"I stayed here from the 16th - 20th of May with my sister.. we came over from England to spend time with a friend who is from NYC who also stayed in this hotel. The room was smaller than expected, no tea making facilities or fridge.. the window wouldn't stay open for the small fraction it is able to and my sister and I (who shared a room) had to wedge it open with a chewing gum bottle in order to get some fresh air. Under the bottom sheet, as we stripped the bed before we left, we saw several hairs embedded in the mattress protector. The room was otherwise clean. The bed was extremely comfortable but down pillows are a huge no-no!! The shower worked well- temperature and flow rate were excellent. When we arrived, we unpacked, freshener up and went out for dinner. Upon return, we were unable to get in to our rooms due to several fire/emergency vehicles. None of the staff addressed the customers to explain what was happening. When we were allowed back in, the elevators were not working so we had to walk up the stairs to the 22nd floor. We were woken again in the early hours of the morning with a alarm and I was unsure in my deep sleep haze whether we were told to vacate our rooms but after seeing others poke their heads out of the door, we all agreed to vacate and had to walk down the stairs to the lobby. We were not informed of what was happening again although it was said that smoke was seen on floor 22 by one person and 6th floor by someone else. We waited for 1.5 hours in the lobby in our night clothes along with other guests. Not once did the manager speak anyone or offer drinks. Again, once all clear, we walked back up to the 22nd floor via the stairs. At 7am we were woken by a loud alarm from the safety manager saying they were dealing with a situation on the 7th floor and we were to stay where we were. 10 minutes later the alarm went again saying the situation had been dealt with... a tired Friday ensued and we were told the elevators were not working all day. Saturday morning, the elevators were not working again.. thankfully, the housekeepers allowed us to use the staff lift to get to the lobby. The Row is in a prime location.. luxury? Not at all. Would I stay again? Probably not ",5/21/19,3
"This was a great hotel to stay in for walkability in the theatre district! Unfortunately for us, the walls are incredibly thin and we heard EVERYTHING our neighbors were doing and they did it a lot . The bathroom was very small, however our view was great and bed was comfortable. ",5/21/19,4
"Wasn't impressed with this hotel at all I'm afraid. Rooms were very basic and not particularly clean. Staff were OK but the place is so busy it never feels ""warm and friendly"". Watch out for the excessive taxes and fees. It's there in the very small print but wasn't expecting another 35% on the bill. Good location though as far as access to the rest of Manhattan is concerned ",5/21/19,2
Due to my knees cap operations for both of my legs. The room was clean & well prepared. Great location to the Times Square with verities of serounding.Be prepared this hotel didnt provided room for returning guest luggage storage IF you have tour scheduling for 4days 3nights to Nigeria Falls,5/20/19,3
This hotel is crap. They advertise a 'FREE BREAKFAST' which doesn't even qualify as 'CONTINENTAL' breakfast. Elevators are appalling. You need to wait 10 mins each time you want to go up or down. Avoid this piece of garbage hotel,5/20/19,1
"Great overall stay with the exception of the bellman rudely letting us know we have to tip. We always tip ,we did not need to be told. The front desk was great. Housekeepers even better. The bar was pleasant and comfortable. Loved our stay for the most part ",5/19/19,4
"Due to various security, fire, and investigation alarms going off I got woken up 3 time through the early hours of the morning. And one of them being 3am to evacuate the building due to a fire. I know not necessarily the hotels fault but it did out a damper on my stay here, being woken up 3 times. ",5/19/19,3
"This has got to be the worst hotel I ever stayed in. Other than its location, there's nothing good about this hotel. The elevator system is the WORST I have ever seen in my 44 yrs of being alive. You have 4 elevators but only 1 is servicing the WHOLE hotel! You waited 10 mins for the elevator to arrive and only to see it packed like sardine. And then you have to wait for that elevator to make its way down, stopping at virtually every floor (because they are also guests wanting to get out of the hotel! ), and pick up the 20 over guests waiting to go up at the lobby. At this rate that it's going, I will never leave this hotel in its ONE and ONLY ONE working elevator.The room is small, bathroom is small, table is small, elevator is small, everything is small. In summary, THIS IS A HORRIBLE HOTEL ",5/19/19,1
"My business meeting was rescheduled for later in the month and I couldn't get a credit to be applied to my future reservation, so I lost my money. I called them and emailed them and never got an answered. I made my reservation on line and I know it was non refundable but I wasn't asking for my money back y just wanted a Credit to use it in my later stay. I ended up staying at a different hotel. Lost my mone ",5/19/19,1
"We had to evacuate our room for two and a half hours in the middle of the night because of a fire. During that time we were give no information or instructions about what was happening in the building. People were definetly upset about way things were handled. No excuses, no apologies ",5/18/19,2
"Was awoken 3 separate times after midnight by a loud announcement about fire and emergency, only to be told after 5 minutes it was fine. The elevator system is painfully slow and overloaded. The bathroom door in the room is a joke, doesn’t even close. Take your money anywhere else! Oh, and calling to complain doesn’t work- they won’t pick up the phone. ",5/17/19,1
"Pick a room on an upper floor. Pay for an upgraded room if you need extra space. Rooms are very tiny. Loved the location. We could walk to Times Square and many theaters. Really enjoyed National Geographic Encounters Experience nearby. Highly recommend Carmine’s, Lily’s Tea Room and Smith’s (across the street) for restaurants ",5/17/19,5
"The hotel is in a great location, times squaresand theaters are near, you don't need to use the subway to get there. The rooms are small but cleanIn other hand, the staff isn't very welcoming, some of them were pretty rude when we arrived ",5/17/19,4
Stayed here for my first trip to NYC. It was just a couple of blocks from Times Square. Very convenient. I saw Lion King and the theater was on the same street as the hotel. I felt safe - night security at elevator. Clean rooms. We had Deluxe room with nice view of the city. The bar on site was very nice - bartender friendly and helpful. Near subways. We walked to and from Penn Station to catch the Amtrak.,5/16/19,5
"Stayed here for 3 nights on the 11th floor but could still here traffic at all hours, wasnt really an issue as i sleep with ear plugs, I recommend to do so if your a light sleeper, plenty of lifts there. Good location for broadway and Times Square/hells kitchen. Staff at reception was nice. Only downside was small outdated rooms with no refrigerator or coffee/tea making options. Great bedding, would stay again if priced right at time of next booking ",5/16/19,3
"Dirty cramped hotel. I wouldn't pay $45/ night for a hotel as gross as this. Needless to say all of our clothes are going right in the washer when we get home, and all of us are showering. The charged us for ""facility fees"" on top of our room cost?? I said I already paid the ""facility fees"" when I rented the hotel. Apparently not ",5/16/19,1
"Great place to stay! I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. The staff made everything easy. The location is convenient to the Theatre District, 5th Avenue, great restaurants, and a good healthy walk to Central Park ",5/16/19,5
"Excellent location, excellent service. Room was small but what we expected for mid-town. The only issue, which wasn't a deal breaker: the windows were really dirty on the outside - even though the view was decent, you had to peer through dirt to see it. The room itself was clean ",5/16/19,5
"I chose this hotel for its location - walking distance to Broadway theaters. I had enjoyed an evening in the quiet bar on a previous trip. Now this is a loud, busy, filled with hipsters and flight attendants hotel. If that's your thing, you'll like it. Beds are thick mushy mattresses on a platform and pillows are lumpy (like MyPillow). Beware $40 daily resort fee, largely for the gym, and not refunded if you don't use the gym. Oud you need an accessible room, check it before you accept it. I requested an accessible shower because the pictures online showed tub-shower. So my shower is more accessible than that but still has a 4-inch sill, so not suitable if you need to roll in. Otherwise not too bad on accessibility. Front desk varies greatly; one could not have been less interested in helping me get the water bottle that should have been in my room and didn't apologize for its absence, while another was very helpful. ",5/16/19,3
The Row NYC is in a great central location.The room was plenty big enough for what we needed it for..A good night's sleep! The beds and pillows were so comfortable. They provide you with a water bottle and there is a water and ice machine on every floor which was a life saver for us.,5/15/19,5
"Location perfect near Broadway and Times Square. Good concept for breakfast, lunch and diner in City Kitchen in hotel on the first floor. Rooms small and not very clean, good beds. There’s WiFi but the working is very bad ",5/15/19,3
Arrived to my room after midnight to find used wet wipes on the night stand. I pull back the sheets to get in bed and there is popcorn in the sheets and on the floor. Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable.,5/15/19,1
Hotel had everything you would want in a hotel. Close to all attractions around time square and the staff was very helpful on my stay. This is a hotel I would not need a 2nd thought to book again when I go back to New York,5/15/19,4
The hotel has a very nice appearance from the lobby. It also has a nice place to check your bags if you arrive early or stay after checkout. Rooms were small but adequate. Our room had a very poor paint job and furnishings looked cheap however bed was very comfortable. Good location for shows.,5/15/19,3
"Not my usual place to stay. Booked it online via app hotelstonight. Hotel lobby and gathering areas very hip and fun and trendy. Convenient location. Desk staff are super nice. Concierge was just so so when I request some info on finding change for a large bill. Room was normal nyc size. Bathrooms small but water pressure was good. The beds were very clean looking, the sheets perfect, very comfortable but the cleanliness detail was lacking in most other areas of room. The furniture visually in rough condition. Fingerprints on doors., dust in bathroom. The complimentary water cups had orange spatter inside. The general upkeep of room was it good. Feel bad saying this cause they did a complimentary upgraded but for the price I paid, definitely not worth it. I also found that google maps show the rooms here as low as 69 a night. Now for that price I would say GREAT. The City Kitchen connected to Hotel is great and sugar is also awesome. This hotel could be great If they would fix the obvious wear and tear and also have someone more detailed for Cleaning rooms. See photos below. ",5/15/19,3
Stayed at the Row because the location is great for the theatre district and Times Square. If you don’t really know NY vey well this is a great place to stay. Also City Kitchen is great and you get 10% off there and Bloomingdales with your room key.,5/15/19,4
"Location is great But our room was awful Mould in the sink. around the bath. Room very small, we had booked for 4 staying never enough towels or face cloths etc Even no toilet roll on two occasions of our 7 day stay. damage to walls. Not enough wardrobe area we had to live out of suitcases. No kettle or Iron etc. we had asked if a refrigerator was in the room and was assured every room had one; Not ours we rung reception to be told they are not supplied after explaining we needed one for our sons insulin eventually one was supplied. The lifts could be very slow at busy times and we along with others were complaining at having to wait up to 15 mins to get a lift to our floor. Would not recommend this hotel and our next visit to N.Y will not include The Ro ",5/15/19,2
"Rooms are small but cleaned daily, great base for all attractions. No complaints at all,reception happy to help with all enquiries. Short walk to Times Square and subway links. Tourist busses stop extremely close and plenty of places to eat just outside the entrance ",5/15/19,4
"I overall really appreciated this spot for my one night need in NYC. It was 15 mins to Amtrak at Penn Station, and they were very accommodating when I needed to check in an hour early in order to shower off my sweat before a Broadway show that started at 3 pm. It's a stylish place, with little rooms and a tiny bathroom, but fine for one or two people. The lobby was a crazy party at night, but surprisingly I didn't hear a bit of it once I got to the room. Super access to Times Sq and all things midtown. Would recommend! :) ",5/14/19,4
Stayed here with a group of girls from check in to check out even was amazing. Made even smoother with Junior on reception who was there for check in and out. Nothing was too much trouble.we will definitely be back. Thank you again Junio,5/14/19,5
"Stayed at Row Hotel, room clean and towels fresh every day, breakfast was continental and tasty, our receptionist Junior was so helpful and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable definitely be back, thanks Junio ",5/14/19,5
In heart of it all easy to find all places to go and see bus for uptown and downtown is close by lots or Fastfood places but hard to a good restaurant Smith’s across the road is good for breakfast and dinner and evening pints area is pricey but you kinda know what you’re getting in to,5/14/19,4
We stayed overnight going on a cruise the next day. Being near Times Square and the cruise pier made the trip hassle free. Enjoyed the room and the staff was very attentive. This was booked through an airline site (Delta) with very reasonable price,5/14/19,4
Great value for staying near times square. Is a bit small but is exactly what you need. Keep in mind that additional taxes have to be paid on site which are not included in the room fare. Its location is excelent.,5/14/19,5
"Stay was just ok. As mentioned the room was incredibly small.....much like a cruise ship.....you have to walk sideways to get past the end of the bed. There isnt even a coffee maker. It was ok for clean but very dated and any of the work done to the room was half assed.....crappy trim work, clunky and runny paint job. However, it is an old building ",5/13/19,3
"Terribly rude and incompetent and careless reservations department staff. Disgusting. Will never stay here and will tell anyone I know traveling to NYC to avoid this hotel. Also, reviews online seem to describe the rooms as being dirty and shabby? Something to look into ",5/13/19,1
"Location is good if you like mid-town west, ideal for theatres. The building and facilities in general are nice, but our overall experience was really bad. 1) Our room which was supposed to be a good (""deluxe"") one and even better after an upgrade ended up being too small (in the bathroom you can barely stand, plus almost no closet). 2) The lobby is nice, only that it is always crowded, including people somethimes eating in a staircase between the bar and a food court, very strange feeling. Breakfast is not bad but too expensive for what it really is (just one pastry, one fruit, one hot and one cold beverage) and -last but not least- 3) I received three envelopes (not boxes, envelopes), I had to go up and down several times to get them and at the time of checkout I was charged usd 33 plus tax (11 per envelope) for ""handling charge"". Unbelievable! It took them forever to take my complain and ended up foregoing some of the ""resort fee"" (which I still wonder what it covers). In short: wouldl never go back ",5/13/19,2
-Easy check in /out-I liked that they checked room cards at the elevator - nice bar/lobby area-great location -many shops/restaurants right outside the hotel-short walk to Times Square and to broadway shows - Central Park about 3.5 km -the oasis if huddle & bustle is not your thing.,5/12/19,4
"A reasonable price for an excellent location. The rooms are clean and basic but provide what you need for a trip to Manhattan, comfortable bed, hot shower and relatively quiet bedrooms. Staff were not overly friendly which was disappointing. ",5/12/19,3
"This hotel is overpriced. The room had pistachio shells in it when we checked in and the elevators take forever to come to higher floors. Pay attention tp the price. Although we paid in the 100s for the first night, the room was charged in the 300s for the other two nights. Definitely not a $300+ hotel ",5/11/19,1
We got our room here through Air BnB. 2 blocks from Times Square and easy walking distance from ship passenger terminal. All the Broadway shows just a few steps away. And a reasonable parking garage around the corner!!! Douglas could not have been more helpful! You will love this place. Can’t beat it for the money,5/11/19,5
"Visited the hotel for some business meeting in nyc, and the experience was ok-minus. Room is small, but has all needed. Wi-Fi is weak, window cannot be sealed (and morning noise is there, if you sleep lightly, it will get to you, even on the 15th floor). Saving packages service has a ridiculously high fee, and besides, the hotel doesn’t inform u there are parcels that wait for your pickup. Excellent base for daily walking trips in the city or outside, right near the 42nd-PA station ",5/11/19,3
The room was smaller than expected and even though I booked a room with a view all I got to see from the window was the back of another building.... The cleaning team didn't show up to clean the room and the next day no fresh towels were provided,5/10/19,2
Gross building with poor customer service. Paid so much for this hotel and got a tiny disgusting room. Floor elevator areas are very dark and uninviting. Rather spend the money else where. Way too overpriced.,5/10/19,1
"Excellent location for show enthusiasts, in the middle of countless theaters. Also a fantastic spot for central Manhattan. Has a sub stop directly across the street to the A,C,E trains for super easy access to uptown, downtown, and Brooklyn. I’m a bit of a food snob, but the food court in the lobby is really pretty decent, with a Luke’s lobster, homemade pastries, street tacos, etc. What truly made our experience memorable was the help provided by a super sweet young lady, Yanelly, and the front desk manager, Ceser. During check in I asked for a room as high as possible. Ceser overheard my request, checked the system, personally ran up to check that the system was wrong and ensure that the room he wanted for us was indeed ready. We received a free upgrade on a huge room, for New York standards, on the 27th floor with a fantastic view of west midtown! In summary, superb service, convenient location, and an fantastic value for the price ",5/10/19,5
We only stayed here one night last minute because we made a mistake in planning our holiday but we got a really good price for a big spacious room with a nice view and a bathroom with a bath. Just overall really good experience with The Row NY,5/10/19,5
Will come back to visit again and I would like to stay and see what changes made but would not ask to change anything. The service was great and very helpful and when needed anything they would be happy to help,5/9/19,5
"Good location, surprisingly quiet, nice variety of good quality food onsite, clean. I wanted a hotel w/ breakfast & parking. By breakfast they have options in food court & by parking they direct you to a lot that they refer to, not one that is attached to or part or the hotel. If you use the parking make sure you get your ticket validated by the hotel for a discount . Helpful knowledgeable staff & a good dea ",5/9/19,4
The desk person treated me as if I was being interrogated for a crime. I was offered upgrades on line(for a fee) but when I inquired about this ( twice) I got blank stares and no response. The lobby is extremely dark and the elevator call system is a joke. The room was minuscule and shabby. Stains on the sheets and questionable dirt drips on the bedside lamp . But worst was the constant door slamming and noise from the adjoining rooms. It was impossible to sleep. Calls to the front desk were meet with voicemail. Apart from the desk crew I never saw a hotel employee except security guards in the lobby. I was put up there for two nights but checked out after one because I couldn’t bear another night in this place,5/9/19,1
"Friendly staff, good location near transport and Times Square, comfortable room. We enjoyed a one night stay waiting for our cruise. We had a great time touring Manhattan, using the subway system to go downtown, Rockefeller Center, and taking in the scene at Times Squar ",5/9/19,5
"I was pleasantly surprised! Yes, you are paying for a hotel in the middle of times square so it costs money. Compared to others in the area its not even bad.. Also, the staff is the best. Checked in 3 hours early to try to make it to a concert I planned months in advance. The gentleman who checked me in made great small convo while trying to see if a room was open, which it probably wasn't, so instead he gave me a free room upgrade to one that was ready. I didnt even need to give a sob story hahaha. He literally just saw that I planned it waaaay ahead of time and asked me about my trip and just ended up doing it. The cleanliness of the room was great! They gave plenty of towels and toiletries. A.c. worked great. Sheets were clean. I'm always afraid to airbnb so if I make the trip up there for another show I'll definitely book again ",5/9/19,5
Always stay at The Row when I’m in NYC for theatre. Can walk to all of Broadway. So convenient. Lovely staff and excellent breakfast (be sure to get the breakfast package). Ask for a room at the back,5/9/19,4
"I was very surprised to see how modern the hotel was, it had a vegas vibe and the staff were all very helpful. There were all sorts of cute amenities like a collapsible water bottle to take and the view was great. ",5/9/19,4
"This hotel was such a pleasure to stay in, amazing staff especially Junior who checked us in, he couldn’t do enough for us even changed our room and gave us a big room with a fab view, ask for room 2108. Savage room I didn’t want to leave, the bar is amazing and clean rooms Honestly can’t say anything wrong about this hotel And thank you Junior it was a pleasure and we will 100% be back! ",5/9/19,5
"The hotel was perfect, the staff were so friendly and helpful, room was spacious topped with an amazing view and in a Perfect location right next to Times Square and easy to walk to Central Park. Our room got upgraded aswell (thanks to Junior at the front desk) which was an extra bonus to an amazing vacation! Thank you again, we will definitely be coming back! ",5/9/19,5
The staff really slow and upsetting. 1 hour line to check in Room was dirty and very noisy Small for the price you getBreakfast is terrible Location is the only good thing the hotel has. The guy in the front desk was a complete disaster.,5/9/19,1
"I travel to NYC on work a lot. A friend recommended me this hotel and have been staying there every time i visit NYC. Perfect location, great bar/lounge, excellent staff all around. Rooms are a bit cramped but the overall experience trumps that. Pizza's are great too and the food court has some mouth watering cuisine ",5/9/19,5
The front desk is not friendly and accomodating we added an extra day and they did not clean our room. They said we have free breakfast but then we were charged for breakfast. We called and ask front desk about it and they seemed not to care and transferred the call to the restaurant.,5/8/19,1
"I used your system: Skip the line! CHECK IN for your reservation at Row NYC! When I arrived, I asked where I could get the key, I was told at the check-in counter. I went there directly and was received by a guy with 2 stars on his jacket who shouted at me to tell me to queue like the others. Finally, I got my key at the same time as my friends.We were thirsty and wanted to have a beer but the bar is closed.We went back to the bar at night to have a chat. Because of the noise we moved into the small room behind the bar. “Sorry we do not serve in this room”. We went to the Intercontinental where we were well received. During the night the A / C of my room started to make an incredible noise, Bing, bang ... I tried everything without success, luckily, I had ear plugs. Jean louis Peti ",5/8/19,1
"Good location: Broadway, restaurants and Times Square are very nearby.Our room was small but neat and clean. Beds are comfortable. However it was very noisy and from our bathroom there was always a very bad smell. Wi-Fi wasn't working well and yet we have to pay facilities fee which I find it very high. Not a stay for the second time ",5/8/19,3
Our agent recommended a number of hotels to stay and then one of our party got a personal recommendation for the ROW. It was cheaper than other options but absolutely fine. I was worried when I found our room was directly opposite the lifts but had no problems with noise levels. Downstairs there is a bar but adjacent is a franchised eating area with plenty of choice. We used this for breakfast every morning as the range was good everyone could have what they wanted. Staff were very helpful and when my wifes face cloth was mistakenly taken the front desk more than made up for its loss without question.The best part about the ROW is its proximity to Times Square all the theatres and central park. If you want to go further afield it is also close to the tube network,5/8/19,4
"Really bad experience ! First we paid a lot of money which is not really worth . Please book another hotel if you have this option ! The rooms are very small ( we booked a superior room got an upgrade to “deluxe “ . Deluxe Room included:Dirty smelled terrible carpet Defect AC ( repaired after complaining)Defect phones ( repaired after complaining )Molded room -bath and “bedroom “- ( no reaction on it - I have an allergy so habe now some health problems ) Windows without any noice reduction , you can hear everything., even if somebody talking on the street.. No slippers No drinking ( complementary) Water ( even there was no bottles )No minibar Bad dirty bedA lot of hotel charges fee ( which not can understand really )So please avoid this hotel if you want a 4 star hotel. If you fine with conditions like in a camping place then it’s an ideal one . They changed our room but it was worser then the”deluxe” one ! So we saw 2 rooms and both really in a poor quality ! Not a “luxury” hotel maybe you get a cleaner place under the bridge then in the rooms of this hote ",5/7/19,1
"It was amazing, the location was just perfect! The rooms were comfortable and in general we had a great experience. We stayed for a week for our study trip to New York with a group of 18 students. The location for us was the best thing because it was so close to Times Square, the hotel is located in the Theatre District and close to the Metro station. ",5/7/19,5
"Let's be honest, the location of this hotel is just perfect. That could be my complete review if I was going to tell you only the positive part of the Row NYC Hotel.If you are Okey, waiting to ages for an elevator and having sometimes almost literally to get into a fight to get in the elevator (Same story in the morning when you want to get down to the lobby of the hotel).We got an ""upgraded"" room on the 21st floor, and believe me if you are waiting a few extra kilos/pounds I think you will have problem turning around in the bathroom if you close the door.No minibar in the rooms. So don't even think in bringing any food or anything that would need cooling into you room.I think my overall experience as a guest in this hotel was just not good. No incidents, just a hotel I was counting down the days to head back home... This is not the feeling I would expect from a hotel just after 3 nights.Anyways.... if you don't care for any of the things I just mentioned and your main concern is location. this is the place to stay when visiting NYC ",5/7/19,3
"Room was dirty and not worth the money. Also, the premium view sucked and was not premium at all. The bathroom had hair from previous guest on the wall upon arrival. Thr blinds were stained as if they had not been cleaned, ever. The pictures online look way better than the actual room in person ",5/7/19,2
"This is the 5th or 6th time staying here. I was in town for work and was conveniently located near where my meetings were held. Also right next to times square and many other NYC attractions. Nothing fancy, but everything you need, and the best location you could think o ",5/6/19,5
"From the slow service at the desk, to the bouncer at the elevators, our stay was a sore disappointment. Since it was during Spring break, the hotel was full and the antiquated elevators couldn't keep up. It's a wonky system where you have to enter your floor and then it tells you what elevator to wait for (which was always full). The hallways are dark, airless and smelled like a diner. The room was a let down and because of the general run-down feeling of the room, I chose not to shower since we were only spending one night (so we could see Harry Potter). There was a curtain on a suspension rod instead of a door for the closet, the remote didnt' work nor did the phone charger. ",5/6/19,2
"I’m 60 and would not stay here alone but it was a great place for me with my son and his girlfriend. With some sprucing up and more lighting, it would be much better. An overall updating would be fantastic. I’d love for it to look as great as the pics portray ",5/6/19,4
"When we arrived we had been in transit for over 30hrs and we obviously looked wrecked. The queue for check in seemed to take forever even though there was only 3 other couples in front of us, when we finally got served the clerk convinced us we would not be able to get any sleep in the room we booked as it was near the elevators and would be very noisy. So he suggested we upgrade for 30usd more a night. The room we got was on the 22nd floor, it was tiny(yes I am aware it's NY) and looked nothing like the pictures on the website. It wasn't what we would call clean, there was stains on the bed sheets, there was gaps in the sealant around the bathtub. To get hot water you had to run the tap for what seemed like an eternity. And what is with the doors to the rooms, the springs are so strong they can knock a grown adult over, and no one ever helps them close so they slam that hard if you're in a room close by it makes the walls shake. When we talked to the reception about our issues they didn't seem to concerned, all the issues we raised she knew about and asked us what we wanted her to do about it. Won't stay again and won't recommend to anyone ",5/5/19,2
Location of the hotel is the best. The hotel is across Shake Shack. It is two blocks from the Ports Authority which is the bus station in NYC. It has plenty of Restaurants to choose from. It is an avenue away from the 9th Avenue which is the Hells's Kitchen are located. Value for Money,5/5/19,5
Standard Queen rooms are a good size.I stayed in a room at the back of the building so there was very little natural light. Wasn't a fan of the barn style door for the bathroom. Close to port authority and Times Square. Subway 2 blocks away so it's a super locatio,5/4/19,4
"Went to NYC for two plays, sightseeing and dining experiences. Didn't spend hardly anytime in rooms. The room was small, queen sized bed and bathroom. Very clean and limited view. Easy check-in and easier check-out. We were offered an upgrade but chose not to accept it ",5/4/19,4
The row was a good location. The rooms were crazy small. The staff wasn't very friendly. The water taps hardly worked or would take 5 minutes to stop spitting. Definitely wouldn't stay there again. Not worth the money,5/3/19,2
Great location but elevators are to slow not a very good system. When we got to our room after a long wait to check in our room was to hot and we couldn't turn the heater off. They moved us to another room Which was fine.. I know it New York and rooms are small but for 4 people the rooms were tiny.. beds super comfy. In the end it's only a room to sleep. You need to look at the elevator system just not working..,5/3/19,3
This is a terrible hotel to stay in there attitude towards customers is disgraceful we had a problem with my wife’s bank account while over there the hotel said we owed them €44 even though we had one night left in the hotel the manager threatened to o throw us out of the hotel we had to call home to get a card so we could get back into our room,5/3/19,1
"My husband and I stayed here in November 2018. We checked into our room after been on the go for about 16 hours. You could not swing a cat in it to the point that we could not put our suitcases on the floor but that was not our 1st problem. It backed onto the lifts and our window was above the air-conditioning unit. After expressing how unhappy we were the hotel reluctantly moved us to another room. Not much bigger but at least it was not as noisy. Location is why people stay here, definitely not for luxury or cleanliness. Oh and the lifts were SLOW AND ALWAYS PACKED!!! The bed was comfy but I cannot any anything else positive about this hotel ",5/3/19,2
"Rooms were too noisy, quality and size of the room to pour, and amenities absent. Huge traffic in the hotel but needs to be redone completely. Nice service desk Breakfast is in between, you queue to get a danish, not ver ",5/3/19,2
great location and price for NYC. Walking distance is good for surrounding areas. Close to places to eat for good prices and food. Room was a little small but you are there to sight see and do things. Close to theaters and shoppin,5/2/19,4
"We stayed 4 nights at Row NYC. Junior checked us in and he was great, very professional and friendly. He upgraded our room at no additional charge and was very informative. The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable. The location is fantastic, right in the middle of Times Square. The bar and City Kitchen restaurant on premises were very good and the bar staff was very friendly. I would recommend staying here ",5/2/19,5
"Book a higher rate room - it’s worth it because the lower rate rooms are extremely small, even for New York. The hotel has a funky look and a good vibe. It’s especially enjoyable if you’re young or young-at-heart and a creative type. ",5/1/19,4
"Hotel is located minutes from time square. There are shops and restaurants on your doorstep and everything is walkable or a short subway ride away. We stayed 4 nights and found that that the rooms are comfortable and clean. The view from the room was great. It does get a little noisy outside at night, but nothing majo ",4/30/19,5
I travel a lot internationally. This hotel is one of the lower ends of the quality. The hotel needs major renovations. Beds are not of good quality. We could hear people talking loud in the next room. The worst part is that the hotel adds 22 percent of tax PLUS $34 facilities fee for each night stay. The hotel manager explained to me that the facilities fee that includes Wi-Fi and gym use is mandatory fee for every guest even though you don’t use it at all. The staffs were not very courteous. I would absolutely not pay expensive rate to stay at this hotel,4/30/19,1
"Our stay at ROW NYC was great! The location, style and facilities were of a good New York calibre. A true New York Gem at a reasonable price, would definitely recommend and would also stay here again. ",4/30/19,4
The room was dirty. The comforter had stains on it. And the sheets were thin and scratchy. The floor also looked like it hadn’t been swept. The room was way over priced for the two night I stayed. I will not be staying there again.,4/30/19,1
"This was our first time to the Big Apple and we loved it! The Row hotel was a great spot to stay. It was an excellent location, room was clean with comfy beds and the attached “City Kitchen” food options were fabulous and so convenient. The only reason I didn’t give it a 5/5 was due to the small room size. We hear this is typical for NY but it would have been nicer to have more space. Overall, it has everything you need (hairdryer, safe). We would definitely recommend. Thanks Row ",4/29/19,4
"We spend 9 nights at The Row NYC, and everything was very very good, Junior received us for the check in, he was very kind and funny, so, extra point for him +++, the bedroom was clean and with a correct size (for new york), we were upgraded after our first night, the second bedroom was spacious and with an amazing view of 8th ave, everything is near from this hotel, subways, every kind of restaurants (extra point for that too), only a few steps from Times Square, everything was clean, and all the personal was adorable with us, the check out at 4am was fast and extreamly easy. Without doubts we will come back. ",4/29/19,5
Travelling as 4 female friends we requested twin share and although told at check in we had an upgrade and beds could be separated this was not the case .... when rechecking we were told they do not supply twin beds at all!! Rooms very small and had to remove excess furniture to fit cases into room! Bathroom had old razor head in corner builders rubble and dirt on ledge under mirror!!! The elevator was a disaster and many occasions required over a 20 min wait ..... only good thing I can say is the location was good!!! Great for single person only in standard room......,4/29/19,3
Great location in Times Square. The Check-In experience was very slow. It took almost 30 minutes to get checked in and had to wait in a long line. I believe it was short staffed because the staff was working as fast as they could at the moment. Also the internet did not work well throughout the building. It was very spotty at times,4/29/19,3
"The few employees we encountered were really nice and the room was clean and therefore is not the reason for my complaint. The reason I am only giving this hotel a 1 star is because our planet is dying and The Row NYC hotel is not helping and is perhaps even making things worse. First of all: we had breakfast every morning at district M, ""having here"", and they do not provide actual cups (strange for a so-called 4 star) and only give you take away cups with plastic lids. they don't even have proper cutlery for you to toast your bread, you have to use PLASTIC cutlery (astonishing in 2019).In the room: - the hotel still gives small plastic bottles for shampoo and soap. Why can't you change to soap and shampoo dispensers? (it would even lower your amenity cost). -Instead of using normal glasses in the room, two PLASTIC SINGLE USE cups are on the desk.I find it outrageous to use so much plastic that will get thrown away uselessly! -In most European and Asian luxury hotels, the hotel provides you with a key card that you can then use to turn on the electricity in the room, and when you leave the room, it will turn both lights and electricity off. But of course, this hotel doesn't have that system which means that if a guest forgets to turn off the lights in his room, it will stay on all day long. -there should be some kind of way to indicate the housekeeper we would like to keep our towels and bed sheets unchanged for our stay. this would reduce water usage.The fact that this hotel is considered as ""GreenLeaders Gold Level"" is a complete joke. Anyone who cares about our lovely planet should favour another establishment.I dearly hope that my comment will be seriously taken into account and that you can explain and justify your way of acting. Kind regard ",4/29/19,1
Room had a dirty thong hanging from the bathroom. The room view was not what I paid for either. The internet wasn’t working either so couldn’t print our tickets. Had to get a manager and send to her email. The elevators take way too long with the way they are designed. Lastly the free continental was really not what showed in the pics for what was available.,4/29/19,2
"Brilliant location, excellent staff. Rooms very comfortable, including all amenities such as ironing board which is always handy and immaculate and food court attached is superb and good value. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good value, well located hotel. ",4/29/19,4
"Rooms are very small with no facilities to make tea or coffee or to sit and relax. The advertisement is very deceiving. The beds are comfortable. The elevators are a nightmare they take so long, like 20minutes on several occasions. It looks like they have squeezed so many rooms into a building but didn’t of the customers. ",4/28/19,2
"Overall outstanding for efficiency, security, cleanliness and LOCATION. From Broadway to my Midtown business contacts to Birdland to Shake Shack to Alamo Rental to great restaurants, I will always return ",4/28/19,5
"Very nice hotel, near times square, subway, pubs and restaurants all over, near everything. nice rooms, very clean, Good service, Exellent service we got there from Christina Santa at the hotel Reception ",4/28/19,4
"This hotel was overall great. Our room was a standard double but we had loads of space. A bed, wardrobe, desk, bedside cabinets! The room was cleaned daily and very well. We popped back to our room during the day to find the cleaner was in their scrubbing away at the bath. Very encouraging! The bed was very comfortable and made every day. The reception staff on arrival were friendly but do not prepare you for your fees on departure. I feel they should do this for people who don't travel often. We received a bill under our door on our last day and instructions on checking our which was helpful. Staff at night time are quite strict and you have to show your room key on arrival. The only downside to the hotel is the lifts. On what seems like an excellent system quickly made us frustrated. Enter your floor number and you are allocated a lift. During quiet times this can be great. Lift within seconds and straight up to your floor. However when you are in floor g and was to go to floor 14, unknown to you are the million other guests who are getting in your lift before and after you and you will stop at every single floor. It will feel like all other lifts are out of use. The lift won't know its full and you will be allocated a lift that is already filled go the maximum and you have to wait a further 10 minutes for a different one. What a faf ",4/28/19,3
"Our stay in ROW NYC HOTEL was made to an excelent by a very nice and kind lady Paola, working in the hotel reception.

"My first time in NYC, so I cannot comment on other hotels, but the size of the rooms at the Row were tiny!!! It was almost impossible to use the toilet as it was jammed between the bath & a wall. To get to the other side of the room, my husband had to move in to a corner so I could walk past - It was like a human Rubix cube. The room was very clean, staff were friendly, and the location was good, that was about all it had going for it. The lifts were very annoying, always full, sometimes having to line up. ",4/27/19,3
"We visited for 4 nights. The location was really good. The room was very small but ok if a little shabby. The bed was comfortable. The BIG downside was the shower. The water barely dribbled out and one day we had no water at all. This was followed some hours later by dirty brown water. When we told the reception we were merely told that they knew there was a problem. It is not really acceptable, especially as it was not a cheap hote ",4/26/19,3
"This hotel one quarter from Times Square had a very good location and view, especially if the room was situated high up. The room was nice and clean and for European standard large enough. TV and wifi worked good ",4/26/19,4
"Where do i begin, a Must, a Most definite Stay. Speak about welcoming! The front desk associate Shantelle was the Best Ever in a class of her own, truly is what customer service stands on. Her professionalism, concern and the ability to share all the happens of the ROW nyc (which is much - if you want to stay inside, dancing, live entertainment and more) and around the city was Amazing. I Thank you Shantelle for your welcoming approach, warm smile and your kindness. After visiting NYC for many of years not to mention other states thru out the U.S, I must say ROW nyc. Stands above most. Did I mention I was welcome with a complimentary Gift to my room. Again above the rest! Thanks guys for a decision well made ""ROW nyc"" the place to be. Thanks a Bunc ",4/26/19,5
"When we arrived our room was so small so we ask for upgrade, we got one but we had to pay. The first two days the bed was not made and I don’t think the washroom was ever cleaned while we were there. Location was good ",4/25/19,3
"We spent one week at the Row with our 2 kids. The hotel is very close to Times Square, lots of restaurants, theaters and shops close by. The suite was spacious with 2 rooms and 2 baths on the 15 th floor. Check in was uncomplicated, Gezennia was nice, helpful and gave us some nice extras. Check out was more complicated because it was not possible to stay 1,5 hours longer in the room. The manager we asked did not react. There was a good breakfast possibility on the hotel we often used. A food court for lunch and dinner was also there although the food was only partly good. Prices of the rooms were ok considering the room size and location. Overall, a good hotel. I have been here the third time and would come again ",4/25/19,4
"It was my second time, and I really -again- love the experience - trendy, young, easy, good service, nice room - extra well located when you like Times Square! The view was amazing as we were located on the 17th floor - thank you! Breakfast improve compare to last time (5 years ago) - choices & freshness ",4/24/19,5
"The hotel is extremelly crowed and noisy. Even with Times Square outside, it seems i side the hotel has even more people. The sheets had stains and the room is really small. First and last time there ",4/24/19,2
"Overpriced for what you get. Rooms are tiny, barely enough room to open your suitcase without tripping up when climbing into bed let alone two suitcases. Agree when in NY you spend little time in your room, but the price paid does not reflect the room provided. Customer service wasn’t great, but I found NY to have the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Surprising seeing as tips are compulsory! Location is right in the heart of Time Square. However if I was going again, I definitely wouldn’t stay in Time Square it’s just packed with tourists and not an authentic any experience. There are much nicer hotels in convenient locations that would be better and probably better value for money. ",4/24/19,2
"Our hotel associate, Junior, was so so kind and accommodating for me and my student's stay! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to NYC for broadway shows or just a weekend of shopping. Thank you, Junior! You totally rock ",4/24/19,5
"This is not my first time at ROW but this top all other visit. My wife and I had the pleasure of dealing with Junior at checking in. After learning its was my wife birthday and not our first time there, he celebrated with us and provided an awesome room with spectacular views!. Truly our best stay in NYC and we owe it to Junior ",4/24/19,5
We surprised my friend for his birthday and everything went smoothly! Place is right next to everything you need food parking and drinks and all around great stay! I would definitely come back again for another stay,4/24/19,5
"My husband and I visited with our teen son and a couple of friends. Stayed in an accessible room as I needed a mobility scooter due to a recent injury. Room was large, very clean, and service was great. Come from Away show at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre was just around the corner. Smith’s restaurant and the Shake Shack, both reasonably priced great food, were across the street. Times Square, Subway, Big Bus Stop #1 all right nearby ",4/23/19,4
"Row was understaffed so it took me an hour to check in, which was not what I wanted to experience after a 5 hours drive to the city. There were so many people, it was crowded, packed and loud at all times. Bathroom was not cleaned properly, there was hair all over the place. And the bathroom had a weird sliding door that does not seal the bathroom, so if you need privacy, you would have to go down to the lobby. Do yourself a favor and stay a little bit further away from Times Square tourist nonsense. ",4/23/19,3
"Excellent location, near Times Sq, theater, and subway. The gym was good sized but no free weights < 15 lbs. Elevators were terrible. The room was in need of updating (some outlets didn't work), painting, and deep cleaning ",4/23/19,3
Stayed for a few nights for work and leisure - good'ish location for midtown and central park - v touristy but makes sense given price - rooms are small but functional and all clean and simple which is a plus in NY,4/23/19,4
We enjoyed our stay at the ROW NYC. Junior from the reception and his colleagues do a great job on welcoming guests and making their holiday better.If we had to name something it would be that some rooms could use some fresh paint or better finishing off.,4/22/19,4
"I don't travel to NYC to stay in a hotel. The Row provided everything I wanted- a bed, a shower, security for my things, and a safe location. It's in the heart of the theater district, near the subway, Times Square, Central Park, shopping, night clubs, and a thousand restaurants. I enjoyed the charm of the place. I'll stay there, again ",4/21/19,5
"Hotel has a great location. Rooms are mostly clean and neat, but too small. I feel the hallway should be lighter as it’s too dark and uninviting, giving a sense of dirtiness that is only perceptive. I enjoyed the breakfast area, but should consider a more ample offering of fruit and oatmeal. I enjoyed my stay and would recommend this hotel due to its location and the fact that it has a lot to offer. One more thing: the bed is the most comfortable I have ever encountered in a hotel. Another thing I might suggest they look into: the elevator system. It’s prone to bottlenecks and people sometimes get worried as they are in a rush (picture check out time or maybe having to get to the airport) and are at a lost as to what to do. This hotel also offers gym, salon and business center, so it’s quite the whole package, all in a modern and minimalist setting. ",4/21/19,4
Broken AC unit. Broken items throughout room. Stains all over desk chair. Broken alarm clock. Unfriendly desk staff. All the money was spent on making the lobby nice. The attached food court was nice and good. Rooms and service definitely were not.,4/20/19,1
"Even though the hotel was jam packed, the way everything was organised made sure no guest felt discomfort of any kind. The way the staff operated, always made us feel cared for and secure, specifically ""Junior"" the receptionist that checked us in. He not only gave us really useful tips on everything to do in NYC ( places to eat, best museums to go to, best places to get the perfect view of the skyline, etc) , but also was very kind and thoughtfull (the fact that he spoke portuguese was amazing). The location was outstanding as it was located right next to Time Square and some great restaurants.In conclusion, it was an amazing experience and we hope to come back very soon. ",4/20/19,5
We totally enjoyed this hotel. Room was clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful. Great location. My daughter has stayed here several times and has always had a good experience. Can't wait to go back,4/19/19,5
"Poor experience in a great city. The hotel is dark, grubby, unwelcoming, out of date, feeling of insecurity. lifts are crowded, rooms are out of date, tv was left hanging off some piece of board barely hanging to the wall, it actually wasn't even powered up on arrival and staff made you feel as though you were a pain when called them u ",4/18/19,2
"The location is excellent for Broadway shows and the subway is across the street. The rooms are quiet and the mattress is amazingly comfortable. Breakfast could be better, but otherwise good food choices at The Kitchen which can be accessed through the hotel ",4/17/19,5
"Last minute trip with great hotel rates. Clean room, friendly and helpful staff and great location to many attractions. Loved being able to check luggage in early and with a late bus departure on our checkout day, keeping our luggage into the evening was a blessing. Even had to go pull some coats from our bags and the staff was great to deal with ",4/17/19,5
"When I arrived at the hotel, my room wasn’t ready, this was at about 11am. Initially, I was okay with this because my flight had landed earlier than planned so things being of schedule was to be expected. I went walking with my friends around the city and arrived back at about 4pm and had been told that my room would be ready at that time, it was not. The staff were rude and unhelpful and would just blatantly ignore my friends and I as we tried to sort the issue. We then went out for dinner and saw some tourist attractions and got back at 10.30pm and our rooms weren’t ready STILL. We tried to talk to staff and managers and they would literally walk away from us. The elevators were useless and took so long to arrive at any floor, and at one point three broke down causing the fire department to come in with AXES. On top of all the problems, we received absolutely no compensation for such a bad night. The next morning at breakfast, the staff at WHITMANS were rude, an employee was on the phone the entire time and they mocked our accents. They even taunted us in Spanish but luckily a friend of mine who speaks Spanish let us know. The food was mediocre at best. I would definitely recommend staying away from this hotel. I would give a half star if I could and that is me being generous ",4/17/19,1
We recently visited the Row NYC for an impromptu weekend that I did not plan very well. The hotel associate Junior was my savior. He was very fantastic! Helped us with our room as well as the town. I would book here again because he left such a positive impression on my husband and I,4/17/19,4
"Booked a room ""special"" that would include tickets to the intrepid museum and "" 3 complimentary rewards for staying with us"". Was told at check in that they did not have any more museum tickets available, we had to buy them ourselves. The complimentary rewards would be provided by a third party, surprise!. I did receive an email from Wanderful.com with 3 links of prizes to be redeemed in the city. The links were expired, innactive, and inexistent. The hotel impose a facility fee on every guest to include the usage of gym and wi-fi, even for those who does not plan to use the gym. Their wi-fi was nowhere to be found. Yet the worst part was having to interact with the front desk at checkout, rather than answering a few simple questions regarding the discrepancy on the charge on my card and the invoice left in the room, the front desk worker just said ""BYE"" and made hand gesture for me to leave the line while calling ""NEXT"" with me standing in front of her not even knowing what I was paying for. She also didn't stamp my parking ticket so I could get the $40 flat parking rate promised on the website.I was physically at the hotel for a few hours, given I checked in Saturday afternoon, attended business meetings elsewhere in the city, and checked out sunday morning.I have suggested to the corporate I work for not to reference this hotel to our foreign and domestic investors, like they have in the past ",4/17/19,1
"Our stay at ROW NYC was horrible and the outlook for future stays is gloomy. We stayed here on our honeymoon and NYC was something we were so excited for! First my husband ran in to see where we could check our bags while we waited to be able to check in so we could run around the city a bit and take our rental car back and a very snotty lady up front with an accent implied that he was trying to gain information that was none of his business even though he was also a guest with me! She even gave me a very bad attitude when I told her that I have a hearing problem and I need him to be able to speak for me since I couldn’t understand her because of her accent. After giving them my debit card info all of a sudden money went missing from my account and then upon check in we had to pay an additional $250 in cash. They put us in a room that doesn’t have proper working cooking & heating unit so anytime we needed to cool off or warm up we had to call to the front desk and deal with the snotty attitudes. We have never been to this hotel before and their attitudes just frustrated us to the point where we just waned to return home to our family in Texas and end our honeymoon early. What bride wants to be crying in frustration while on her honeymoon? We couldn’t even ask any questions because the staff treats their customers like they’re idiots. The only staff that was nice, friendly and helpful was housekeeping. Those ladies always had a smile on their faces and they always greeted us whenever we saw them. Rest assured we will not be staying in this hotel when we return to NYC in the summer for our family vacation. ",4/17/19,1
We had some issues with a few things but then met a great staff member name Ceaser who was fantastic with us and helped us with everything we needed. Overall it was a perfect location and a great hotel . Def Stay there again .,4/17/19,4
Hotel rooms were a little small but we only slept there. Staff was overall very friendly and willing to help. Many security guards constantly checking everything. The breakfast was outstanding!! Great danish and the coffee was amazing. Great way to start the day.,4/16/19,4
"Pretty old hotel. Overpriced. Good location. Centrally located near Time square and Bryan park. Shoebox room. Breakfast: 2 pastries, 2 coffee,1 yogurt cost me 28$. It was easy to find metro station and Greyhound bus terminals  ",4/16/19,2
"The cleanliness of the room, mainly the bathroom was really bad. Hotel to lousy, we can listen everyone in there rooms. First night they put me on a room next to the elevator, couldn’t sleep all night. Staff was very nice. Breakfast really expensive for the options available. ",4/16/19,2
Wonderful hotel where everyone is always very kind and you have the best location in all Manhattan. The food at the Kitchen is delicious and you can eat there or at the bar. Excellent place to go for holidays or for work,4/15/19,5
"Room was small, but for a one bedroom it was perfect for me and my guest. Wouldn’t be ideal for a “party room”, but perfect to sleep in and has a desk if you need to do work. Close in proximity to anything you would want to go to. Staff was friendly and fast to act with a small issue we had. Hotel has a candy shop/bakery attached to it. Great price for where it is! It’s a 12 min walk tops to every place we went. Hard Rock Cafe, stardust diner, all the theatres, Japanese book store, Nintendo store, plenty of bars and ramen shops ",4/15/19,5
"If you are on a business trip and not spending any time in the room and dont want to spend a fortune this is perfect - the bar is fine for a drink and a snack and location suits midtown as close to 5th , park and a walk between 20th to 40th cross stree ",4/15/19,4
"Not a staid or stuffy hotel, excellent music of all kinds in the lobby and restaurants. The food is really good, especially The BOX and Sugar Factory. There is much activity and people in the lobbies but very quiet in the rooms, they run a tight ship and excessive noise in the rooms is not allowed. They have security make sure that non-guests are not allowed near the elevators unless with guests. Rooms are small and comfortable. But it is safe in the area. The people are nice and they are quite attentive The Apple computers and computers are slow though, not good for tickets. Near Broadway and the subway and restaurants and near Times Square and other attractions. But NY tourist food is like Paris tourist food, meh. So eat in the hotel ",4/15/19,5
Friendly and helpful staff. Hotel was ideally located near Times Square and the theatre district. Self check in at 4 o’clock was a bit of a mob scene (not a big fan of self check in). The rooms felt a little austere. Clean! Had corner room with wonderful views in two directions. Price of room beat other hotel prices in the immediate area. Bar and food on the premises. Live entertainment the night we were there,4/15/19,5
"The hotel is situated in a perfect spot in manhattan , room is a bit small , but all you need is a place to sleep and shower. Security is great , check in staff very friendly. up to date with technology. online check in and online check out availabe. internet fast. ",4/15/19,4
"Paola was amazing! Such attentive service and so nice as well. The parking lot was so close to the hotel as well. The hotel room was really nice too, with all the amenities I could have asked for and more ",4/14/19,5
"We stayed here for 5 days and had a great stay. The hotel is in a fantastic location and within walking distance for most attractions. It's around the corner from Times Square, Broadway shows, 5th Ave and a great coffee/brunch spot called Bluestone Lane (We ate there everyday!). The rooms were fairly small but it was very modern and nicely decorated. The room was fairly clean but probably could have been cleaner. One negative about our stay was that although we had already paid for the room in-full but upon check-in, we had to pay another $190 USD fee that wasn't explained to us properly. We would consider staying here again ",4/14/19,4
"Overall the hotel was really good, the staff was helpful and quick to help if they're was an issue. The only bad thing would be the elevator who took a while to arrive to the rooms when the lobby was crowded. ",4/14/19,4
"Slow check-in, noisy heating system, and bathtub not spotless, but if you want to attend a Broadway show the location is hard to beat. There was a certain coziness to the room and the lighting was good. ",4/14/19,4
"The rooms and the location is really great, but the attendants were really rude with us. In addition the chekin queue was giant everyday. It's sad to say it, but we would not go back to this hotel ever ",4/14/19,2
"The Row Hotel is a very attractively priced hotel close to Times Square. Rooms are clean and comfortable, offering basic amenities. Very nice lobby and café, and nice restaurant. Elevators can be crowded, so if you are traveling for business and need to make it to an urgent meeting, take into account long waits in the morning (and full elevators). My room was a ""superior"" room, but was missing a ""Do not disturb"" sign, and housekeeping kept interrupting me while on a business conference call in the morning - not very productive; but otherwise very nice hotel ",4/13/19,4
The location is easy access to all parts of Manhattan. We had a great view from the room and the services available was good. The room was rather small and even though we booked with two double brds it was suitable for two persons,4/13/19,4
"Only one good point and that's the great location. After that, this hotel just got worse and worse each minute we were there. Upon checking in, the receptionist was extremely rude and VERY unwelcoming (after a long flight this was the last thing we needed!). She was not helpful at all and found her to be disrespectful and patronising, acting as though she was better than us. We also thought the fee you need to pay is far too high. As well as the facility fee of $260, we also were expected to pay a $400 deposit. As we didn't have a credit card, we had to pay this in cash, which she was less than impressed about. Finally getting into the room and falling to sleep, we were woken up by another guest walking into our room, saying he had just been assigned this room when checking in. This made us feel very unsafe and went down to reception to complain. They said they would cancel the key cards to make sure only we had access to that room. However, going back to the room we couldn't open the door, finding out they had cancelled our cards as well as the extra ones! Unbelievable that we had to go all the way down to reception again (bearing in mind we were on the 22nd floor) to get them to activate our cards so we could get in. Moments after getting back to the room, a housekeeper walked in with no explanation, by this time it was about 11pm. We were woken up a second time later that night, this time by an evacuation. Taking the stairs downstairs, we discovered there was a flood on one of the floors. Staff were trying to sort it and shortly after we were let back up to the room. This first night was a disastrous experience to say the least. The rooms are small, but adequate if you're only in it to sleep like we were. The line for reception was always long and didn't see the staff smile once. Large groups of school/uni students staying here was also super annoying, taking up all the space in the eating/seating areas. Overall, if you care only about location, this is great, but for a stay with comfort, ease and good staff then I would not recommend. We won't be back ",4/13/19,2
Definitely consider staying at Row NYC Hotel. Great value at an excellent location. Hard to find value in NYC. Many would be surprised by the value option of Row NYC Hotel. I will stay at Row NYC Hotel again.,4/13/19,4
"On the outside the ROW looks luxurious, modern & most of all clean. THAT IS THE FURTHEST THING FROM THE TRUTH. The tub had hair on the walls... DISGUSTING & on the floor of the tub was filled with stains. DEPLORABLE. The bedroom linens were just as gross. The pillow cases had stains on them & to make matters worse the AC was hard to control. It was extremely cold in the room. It felt like finding the cure for for cancer trying to regulate the temperature. I Will NEVER STAY AT THE ROW EVER AGAIN!!!!!! ",4/12/19,1
"This hotel was a gem to find. It is in the heart of Manhattan, right around the corner from Times Square, without being noisy at all! The City Kitchen within the hotel offers food all day, somewhat pricy but very good if you’re after something to grab and go. The room we had was very small but it was super clean and the bed was comfy (for after long days walking) and the shower was hot and powerful. There are several main Theatres a stones throw away and just outside the hotel is a set of bars, restaurants and food halls, many of which we tried and they were all of good standards. The road to your right is ‘Restaurant Row’ don’t miss out on this, it has many interesting restaurants to choose from. This hotel was very busy but surely this is a good sign? Especially as many many airline crews stayed at the hotel too. All in all ROW NYC is a very good hotel in the heart of Manhattan and I’d recommend this hotel to friends and family. ",4/12/19,4
"This was our second trip to New York and first time at Row. The staff are amazing, in particular Miss Paola, who was extremely friendly and helpful. Love that they have security to control who can gain access to the floors, and you definitely can’t beat the location. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Our next trip to NYC we will be staying here again for sure! ",4/11/19,5
"Everything was ok. Room was clean. The gym was very well equipped. The location is very convenient. Excess to various metro lines and plenty of eateries.But the surprise facility fee during check out was not called for. Overall, my bill was 25% higher because facility was not included yet. At this price, there are better option at time square area. ",4/11/19,3
"did not like the hotel, be aware that when checking in they will charge you $40 / day for wi-fi and gym and it is mandatory, so be advisedthe room is very tiny Good thing is the hotel has a great locatio ",4/11/19,1
The hotel is trendy in a cool location. Some of the items need to be updated. The rooms are super small but maybe that is an NY thing. The check in line was really long both times we checked in. They have guards that keep non guests from coming up the elevators which makes it seem more safe,4/10/19,3
"The Row is situated one street from time square. The staff were all very helpful and friendly from reception to security to bar staff who made cocktails that's weren't on the menu if asked.The room size was decent for NYC, the only thing I would add is a kettle for coffee/tea. Subway station across the road which had access to alot of lines to travel easily around NYC. Only negative thing I would say is not being able to check in early and have been on early morning flight from the UK arrived at midday. We left suitcases at hotel then stayed close by the check in at 4 to freshen up and then go back out. Would recommend hotel to friends and family, was recommended by my brother who stayed in the hotel in December 2017 ",4/10/19,4
"Clean, the price is right, and location is even better. I only stay at this hotel when I come to NYC. they are getting busier as they deserve the praise, but they will never let you check in early, which is a little frustrating but it also causes there to be long lines around the check in time (4pm) and check out time (12pm). I think if they had more staff around the busy times or started letting people check in early, I could give this hotel 5 stars without hesitation. ",4/9/19,4
"Special thank you to the entire staff for making my trip to ny a memorable one! Thank you Kunal and the housekeeping team! The PM housekeeping manager Honey was spectacular! Director of housekeeping Gina was also a delight, she reached out several times during my stay! Xoxo until we meet again ",4/9/19,5
"Should be called a youth hostel. Ridiculously small rooms and bathrooms, dark hallways, Mean and unfriendly staff. Ice machines don't work, Elevators didn't work, nasty doorman and not enough knowledgable people working front desk ",4/9/19,1
"A block from TImes Square, next to the subway station, ROW is really at the best location for visiting NYC as a tourist. And easy to access from JFK with the Airtrain and subway, manageable even with heavy luggage. We stayed there with my teenage son for 5 nights in March. The staff is really helpful and friendly, we were warmly welcomed by Cristina. The concierge Anita booked us tickets to the Empire State etc, so that was also easy and no extra charges. There was a feeling of security to have the staff check out our room keys at the elevators. Our room was on the 26th floor, great view, spacious room, a little wear and tear but clean. It was quiet, if it is ever quiet in NYC, but there were thin walls... Really comfy beds, nice sheets and clean towels every day. Our stay included the continental breakfast and that was just that: coffee of your choice, a bagel or other pastry, an egg, orange juice and a fruit. But it was nice that you didn't have to go out before breakfast. Although there is a food court inside the hotel, so it's easy to get a coffee and croissant anyway. Would stay there the next time too ",4/9/19,4
"Zero stars. The customer service is terrible, Had to complain multiple times before items were fixed. No ac, no way to turn off heat, they supply a space heater if it's too cold? , trash literally every where for days, we had trash outside our room for over a day before it was picked up, wifi didn't work, TV and half our outlets didn't work in our room, took us 25mins to extend our stay, calls to front desk and manager were dropped or left to voicemail, they charge you for having a package delivered, we were offered drink tickets to a bar that's never open, we were finally compensated with a bigger room but then charged for that bigger room rate. My partner and I are frequent travelers and I would NOT wish this hotel upon my worse enemy ",4/9/19,1
"The hotel's slogan is ""More NY than NY"". If you want a New York experience of dirty streets and small accommodations then this hotel is the place for you b/c the rooms are dirty and small. The photos are deceiving. Management could care less about your complaints. ",4/9/19,3
"This place has it all ,been twice now ,excellent both stays, Best price, I surfed every day for weeks close to Theatre District & Times Square I hope this jewel survives and no ownership or upper management screws this place up  ",4/9/19,5
"Times square location... very busy area and good spot for plays. Muriel and German were most kind to us. Perfect spot if coming to NYC for plays. Inexpensive for NYC neat, tidy, clean...NO thrills. Comfortable beds, good shower with plenty of hot water ",4/9/19,3
the row hotel experiene was a good one. Room was clean and airy. Actually had a fine view of the Hudson River alomg with city scene. My concern is in the bathroom. Plenty of towels available. However Zthere should be a safety bar in the shower and a rubber mat,4/8/19,4
"A great experience from the time we arrived. Quick check in, courteous staff, loved the rooms. The Row is located in a perfect location for seeing the shows. There is a great selection of places to have a nice sit down dinner or lunch. Several nice bars and pubs to go in to get a couple of drinks and relax. We have been in NYC at least once every year for the past 7 years and the last two times we stayed at the Row. I don't think we will try any other place as it gives us everything we need. ",4/8/19,5
"This hotel was recommended to me by a friend. It is located in a great area with plenty of restaurants, shopping and just a few blocks from Times Square. Rooms were very nice and clean. We will definitely be back. ",4/8/19,5
Have stayed at this location a number of times over the past several months and have enjoyed the convenience of the location midtown as well as the quality and comfort inside the hotel. This is a trendy setting with a bar and multiple restaurant options in the building. Staff is very helpful and courteous,4/8/19,5
"Very well located. Near Port Authority bus terminal, therefore subway station (line blue). Many restaurants, coffee shops and drugstores nearby.In the Broadway, for those who appreciate musicals. Central Park at close reach as well as UN, downtown ",4/8/19,4
"As I can see I am not the only one who’s writing a bad review about this hotel. First of all, I was upset with the additional fees that were not displayed on my agent, Almosafer, site when I booked my room. There was no information giving about the fees on facilities within check-in. However, Rooms are very dirty and dusty, even when a house keeping lady clean the room everyday she didn’t even wipe the countertop and the bathroom well, they just change the towels which are torn and yellowish color, it’s really a disgusting thing that I ever experienced. Also, when I removed the bed sheet from the bed I saw all kind of hair underlying the sheet!! Was I sleeping on this bed!!! And another thing whenever I dialed “0” to even speak with the front desk or the room services no one picks up the dam phone, and once I complained about that they told me we have shortage in our staff! I was like oh really then why you are still running this business!! In the end I am extremely disappointed to call this place as a hotel, Airbnb much more cleaner than this. It was the 10 worst days in NYC. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE. ",4/7/19,1
Excellent location with plenty of amenities in the hotel. Walking distance to all broadway shows and Times Square. All other areas of New York easily accessible from subway at Port Authority just two minute walk from hotel.,4/6/19,5
"The hotel is very old, very dirty, rooms are small. There were no fridge nor water cattle in the room. Rooms and corridors are very dark with bad lightening as well.The only thing I injoined in the hotel wasits location close to times square ",4/5/19,1
"So I would give a 5 stars for location and very friendly staff.... as for the hotel itself.... the lobby and city kitchen is the best part of the actual hotel.... the rooms were beyond small even with upgrade and I get it because its NYC but I have stayed in nyc on numerous occasions at different hotels and had more space than whats offered here..... on top of that the rooms were dusty I really just felt so uncomfortable to where I layed towels on the floor to walk around. Initially I wanted to leave and lose the money that's how bad it was, but my fiance convinced me to stay because we were only there for 1 night for the Hamilton play. The toilet was one that u would find in a fast food restaurant.... there is a sliding door as the bathroom door that doesn't really close and is heavy/dirty (no privacy) so stay with someone that you really are comfortable with.... The tub had mold growing around it and you saw all dirt on the floors as if they only come to change out the towels and toiletries..... We also didn't sleep under the covers... So if location is what you want this is the place but not for extended periods of time... 1 night max I would say.... If i could do it again I'd sacrifice location for a better room that i felt comfortable in ",4/5/19,1
"TKO band, led by Timatha brought it on a Thursday! Great music! So much fun and it really enhanced our night out! They killed it and we danced til we dropped! Highly recommend a visit. We really appreciated having the bar/band so close to where we saw Phantom! Great night out ",4/4/19,5
"Rude staff. Tiny room. Towels all torn. Pictures from website does not match the actual experience. At the moment of the online reservation, I was able to choose between I full or queen bed and I had a full bed. Heater turned on suddely and I asked the staff to turn it down 4 times and they didnt reponded me ",4/4/19,2
"Check in receptionist was extremely rude, scoffed at us when we were upset with added fees which were not displayed on the Expedia site. No information given about facilities on check in, even after we asked she was extremely unhelpful. Consistent issue with loud music and smell of marijuana on our floor, when we raised this issue with reception they said they would transfer us to management and we got no answer or help with the issue. We tried to call back throughout the evening and got no answer. Staff at elevators were rude and sarcastic when we tried telling them the elevators kept dropping us on floor four which seemed to be a housing initiative and not hotel guests, with no way to get to our room on the 14th floor. Extremely disappointed with this so called hotel (more like an apartment complex with a check in desk) and Expedia for misrepresenting what we would be getting for our money. Room is extremely dusty and worn. Beds not even made correctly. Spent a lot ofmoney on this hotel for 6 nights and we were given little to no service for this and no care was given to our stay. ",4/4/19,1
"Good hotel, great service, small rooms. Wish there had been ventilation and adult size toilet. All staff members were very friendly and helpful. Excellent location to so many different points in the city. ",4/4/19,4
It was just fine. It wasn’t the worst but it wasn’t the best. Yeah people outside were noisy but I don’t think that’s the hotel’s fault. There were also some minor damages but it wasn’t anything to complain about.,4/2/19,4
"Would definitely stay again! Room was a bit smaller than I thought would be but still very pleasant. Friendly staff all around and clean rooms. Glad they let us keep our luggage there after checkout, would stay there again ",4/2/19,5
What got me upset was that this hotel charge $70 for parking for only 24 hours and if you need your car within those 24 hours they charge you again $70 for other round of 24hours only when you come back with the ca,4/2/19,3
this was a good stay at the Row in NY. safe clean and close to time square. very fair for the price .and the staff was nice.for sure we might return.i travel with my daughter and we are from Miami. thanks,4/2/19,5
I recently stayed overnight at this hotel for an event..my retirement party. It met all my expectations and was a totally enjoyable stay! The room was immaculate and the bed was heavenly. I will definitely be staying here again!,4/2/19,5
"Very cool hotel!! A very chill place with great rooms. The location was also right in the middle of all the places we wanted to go. My friends and I loved the room and can’t wait to come back! Checking in was honestly the best part, Paola is amazing!! ",4/2/19,5
"Id stay here if you'd want to be close to times square but not on it. Ease to so many shops, food and plays. Near times square and a good price. Small rooms but clean, fast elevators, helpful staff. Id stay here again, overall would definitely recommend ",4/2/19,4
"very near times square, great staff, decent breakfast, fair price. very busy elevators in the am, great security We would suggest this to friends over the 500 per night hotels, it was just what we neede ",4/2/19,4
"The Row NYC Hotel is in a great location in the New York theatre district. The hotel is one of the older New York City hotels, but the lobby and public areas have been nicely updated. Rooms are small, but very clean and comfortably accommodated with modern decor. The included breakfast was classy continental and quite enjoyable in a true New York cafe setting. Hotel elevators are programmed to minimize wait time and transport time (nice!!!). For a better visual experience, you may want to request a city view. ",4/2/19,4
"One block from Times Square, within easy walking distance to many theatres, subway, buses, and restaurants. This was my fourth stay at The Row NYC, and all the staff is very helpful and friendly. Need multiple rooms? Josephine Jun, in group travel, is wonderful to work with. ",4/1/19,5
"I’ve stayed at this hotel for many years now. I’m seldom disappointed. The beds are comfortable, and the room clean. You really can’t beat the location, and the price is usually pretty good for the area. ",4/1/19,4
"They gave us an awesome room with a view, answered all of our questions and were always smiling. Caesar and Shantelle at the front desk were so helpful and accommodating.We felt very safe at the hotel. It was suer close to the Broadway show we were seeing and several awesome food places ",3/31/19,5
"I was very well met by a hotel employee (Junior), I have no previous experience in New York! He taught me very well in all the procedures and gave tips on locomotion in the city that was very useful to me! Very polite ",3/31/19,4
Hotel was a great location for walking every which direction in the city. Staff was friendly and helpful with any questions or concerns. Price was very affordable for the location and the bed was very comfortable. Many great restaurants in the area along with a food court right in the hotel,3/31/19,4
Great choices to eat right inside the hotel. The room we were in was very small and the sink was next to the toilet so the bar hit your hip while sitting. But it was nice to see that if you did not have a room key you could not wonder onto the floors,3/31/19,4
"Excellent location @8th Ave which is just next to Times Square 7th Ave. Plenty of eateries around from deli to convenient store; and fast food to chain restaurant! In fact, the popular City Kitchen is located within the hotel with great eateries from local to Japanese to Mexican cuisine. Our favourite is Dough! Nevertheless, the room is good for 2 with big luggage though the bathroom is a bit tiny and the bed is too soft for us with only 3 pillows. Also, no kettle and slipper. Fortunately, the room is equipped with an iron, ironing board and hairdryer with nice amenities, but no toothbrush. Helpful front desk and left baggage unit at the ground level. Overall, a great stay though it could be better. Not perfect, but would still stay @Row the next time and indeed, worth recommending it to those traveling to NYC. And, 6 days is not enough for NYC as there are still many other places to explore. Finally, opt for Topview Sightseeing Bus to enjoy the city! ",3/31/19,4
"The location of the hotel is great. 5 mins to Broadway and Times Square. Plenty of eateries around. Hotel even have an attached foodcourt, manned by individual vendors. Quality of the food in the foodcourt is not that great, but, it's no fault of the hotel. Cleanliness of the rooms is bad. Carpets are dirty. Corners of the bathroom, full of dust. The hole in the wall, covered with a curtain (which is passed off as a clothes wardrobe) is filthy. It is simply a hotel (of this grade and price) with the dirtiest rooms I have ever come across. Size wise, the rooms are not large. But, this is to be expected for a city, boutique style hotel. The wait for the elevator can be long. I have seen guests wait up to 10 minutes for the elevators ",3/30/19,3
"We stayed here for 5 nights. Initially when we checked in we weren’t impressed with our standard room as it was very small. We went to reception and were able to upgrade to a king room which was much better.The rooms are clean and nice, however, our room which was a corner room so had two windows was very noisy. It was like we had the windows open all night or we were at street level. We could also hear our neighbour, not sure if this was because it was a corner room? Also, we had to run the shower for 15 min at least before the hot water came through in the shower if it did at all. Had a few cool showers ",3/30/19,3
"A Big Thank you goes to Robert at the front desk for helping us get the best room- he was very kind & very helpful! Rownyc has the best location- very near Times Square- Also, there are 8 elevators & they keep the flow of people moving.. we would definitely stay there again. ",3/30/19,5
". The check in was easy, the lady behind the counter was super helpfull and the best part of my stay. The room was claustrophobic. I realize that real estate is prime in Manhattan but it was like a jigsaw puzzle trying to get my bags and me into the room since the door just barely misses the bed. I had to walk sideways to get from one side of the bed to the bathroom because (and I measured) it is sixteen inches between bed and wall with flat screen TV. the bathroom doorway requires you to enter sideways as well. the thermostat never worked so I regulated temp by opening the window until it was freezing in the room and then shutting it. There is a little desk against the length of the wall with the entrance door. If you want to feel like you live in a martial law state, this is where to stay as well. I love security, but they scare the crap out of you with all their threats about noise and smoke. The guards walk the halls continuously. There is no soundproofing in the hotel and i could hear everyting my neighbors were doing. If they were going to cut down on noise, they should start with staff. Maybe it was because my room was next door to the staff lounge and I coulds hear everything that was going on as they yelled back and forth between themselves. From what i overheard the employees are disgruntled with tight fisted management. There is no coffee in the room or room service. the price i believe was to much for what you got ",3/30/19,3
"This was our second stay at the Row NYC. Our impression of the property has not changed except to say it's better than last year. Location, service, room are all terrific  I guess if we tried we could find something to criticize but that would take more effort than it is worth. We will be back again and again ",3/30/19,4
"The hotel offers great value for money, centrally located, clean and the staff is really nice and helpful, particular the people at the breakfast buffet and Shantelle at the reception who went out of her way to help us. 10 stars to her ",3/30/19,5
"At first, there was a lady at the reception who clearly didn’t care about our check in. We were assisted by Douglas from reception and he was helpful. Very fast wifi, good room service, good air-conditioning. Over all i recommend a stay at this hotel ",3/29/19,4
"There's a lounge with a digital art gallery, and an excellent food court that sits adjacent to the elevator, as well a convenience store and an underground salon. There's also a gym and a fitness studio with indoor cycling.. So many amenities in one place. I visited the salon twice, and took two indoor cycling classes during the week that I was there.The Housekeeping Staff was AMAZING.. the front desk associates were decent.. I literally had no issues with this hotel, until I checked out. Thats when I was charged a bunch of double fees, and weird hidden fees, that totaled over $300, that was supposed to be refunded but never was. I have called several times and nothing was ever done about it. I am still giving a positive review because the hotel itself is great, just beware of the billing practices ",3/28/19,5
"Amazing location, really easy to find, and near tube stations. Felt safe in this part of NYC too. The hotel itself seems a little run down, not much attention to detail, but when youre in NY, youre not really spending much time in a hotel room i suppose! Bar downstairs really good, lovely staff. The only really bad thing was the hidden charges, (had to argue about charges to the room that we didnt make) and also, on the website, it says if youre paying via cash - which we were - only a $200 deposit is to be made for the room. However, we were charged much more than this. i understand you get this back at the end of the holiday, but it still meant we had less than we had budgeted for in the end! Overall, 3 Stars, the sheer lack of compassion from the staff when trying to explain about the $200 rule on the website has brought this hotel down in stars ",3/28/19,3
"The location of the hotel is excellent, however the room was tiny and dirty, even though it was a Deluxe double room. After a skip the line web check-in, we had to queue for half an hour so as to get the keys to our room. ",3/28/19,3
"Best price for a decent room in Times Square. Small but nice room however it was not equipped with a coffee maker. Right in the heart of the city, food and entertainment in house and everything within easy reach ",3/27/19,5
"The location is as solid as there is in midtown. The accommodations were pretty wretched. Reservation said no fees, yet at checkout there were. Need the GM to round up the staff and get in their heads that the guests are the priority ",3/27/19,3
"Do not stay at this hotel. I was charged $200 incidental fee. $100 room deposit and $200 dollars facilities fee on exit. These are extortionate charges. And check what your paying for as they tried to add breakfast charges on, I booked room only! Only good thing about the hotel is location and the cleaners do a fantastic job. My room.was cleaned every day ",3/27/19,1
"Our room was great, always clean and ready whenever we got back. The staff was very kind and helpful and always ready to help us, no matter what we needed. When we had a problem they instantly solved it. Although we didn't experience the breakfast service we did had a bite at their cafè, and we can assure the food was great. ",3/27/19,5
"This is a great location. We were able to walk to all the Broadway shows and it was only a block from Times Square. The rooms are small, but clean, unique, and fun! This was my 3rd time staying at the Row, and I especially loved having a city view. ",3/26/19,5
Well I needed to get away and relax that was the main reason I booked my stay at the hotel to rest and relax catch a show see a movie eat good food at the best restaurant as possible and get a lot of sleep,3/26/19,5
"We are currently enjoying our stay at Row NYC! At first glance the hotel is stunning, great from the outside and the lobby is immaculate! We arrived a little early for our check in and our room wasn’t ready so we got an upgrade, the AC wasn’t working in the room and despite the engineer trying to fix it, the unit needed to be replaced which we were told could take up to an hour and at this point we were very tired. This was when our mediocre experience turned fantastic, we were greeted at the front desk by two VERY friendly staff called Paola and Cristina, who immediately rectified the situation and gave us yet another upgrade! We are now in a spectacular, spotless, spacious room with a breathtaking view. Anything we need be it recommendations, directions or even a good conversation, they are always there to help. I have NEVER in my life received such great service. We will more than definitely stay here again, and again, and again. Thanks Row NYC. ",3/26/19,5
Excellent location. Junior at Front Desk was amazing. Rooms were tiny but completely adequate. Slept well. Clean except dust in corners of bathroom floor. Food at City Market was excellent. Breakfast was simple but good. Staff very nice. 3+ rating. Overall would stay again,3/25/19,4
"Fine hotel in near all the Broadway shows and at great value, rooms are comfortable, clean and quiet. All you need for a business or personal trip. The location is perfect in Midtown. Easy access from la. Guardia airport by public transportation ",3/25/19,4
"My partner booked this hotel for a last minute trip to NYC. The reviews weren’t exactly the best but we thought we’d give this hotel a go.I will start with the positives. The location is great, literally a block from Times Sq, Port Authority bus station and within walking distance of the main mid town attractions. The hotel has a good lift system as well you never have to wait forever for a packed lift to arrive. The rooms were very small but comfortable, good for a quick visit to NYC.Now for the negatives. I’m going to be harsh as so many other reviews have said exactly the same thing....the hotel is dirty. The lifts had rubbish on the floor like old coffee cups. The carpet in my room had clearly not been hoovered for a while. The carpets are black so they show up dirt very easily. The bathroom surfaces had a few hairs from previous guests, so not acceptable. With so many reviews all commenting on the cleanliness of the hotel why is nothing being done about it?? This hotel could be so much better if the cleaning was properly addressed. I would also like to add that the chap who was dealing with luggage was rather rude and abrupt. As soon as I handed my luggage over to him he barked at me to leave him a tip. Overall I probably wouldn’t stay at this hotel again, unless the cleanliness issue is addressed. It’s such a shame the hotel is let down by this. ",3/25/19,2
"I booked a last minute reservation at the ROW NYC. Shantelle made check in so smooth and I was up in my room within minutes. They also informed me that you can make any international call for free from the room, so that is great for international guests. The hotel is brilliantly designed and there is a bar and lounge area that is very hip downstairs. My first room was nice and bright, lots of green colors and surprisingly spacious because of the way the room is organized. I was not happy with the shower and went downstaits. This is when Shantelle went above and beyond for me. She not only changed my room but put me in a suite. When I say it is the nicest hotel room I think I have ever been in. Panoramic views of the city and a oversized shower were my favorite aspects of the room. The only thing I didnt like is that I only got to enjoy the room for a little bit because I had to leave in the am. I honestly considered delaying my trip just to be able to enjoy the room a little longer. Shantelle!! Thank you soo sooo much your the best! ",3/25/19,5
"My theatre travel agency Curtain Up Theatre Tours just spent 5 nights at the ROW Hotel this March. This is a wonderful place to stay for groups coming to New York to experience Broadway. The location is ideal as theatres are right outside the door. Restaurant Row is just down the street on 46th and Hell's Kitchen restaurants are just to the west. All 35 of my participants raved about their stay at the ROW. The sales staff, Eliana and Josephine made the booking and arrival flawless. We were greeted by friendly hotel staff and throughout the stay everyone at the hotel assisted in anyway needed. Highly recommended. I will stay here with another group in October. Looking forward to the retur ",3/25/19,5
Buyer beware. When booking make sure you read the fine print because the $40 facility fee they will charge you even if you don’t use the facilities regardless it’s almost Nonsense fee just for staying. It was one block away from everything room with a decent cansidering its Manhattan. Couldn’t ask for a cheaper room in downtown Manhattan for the quality just that fee pissed me off at the end.,3/23/19,4
"Microwave and a mini refrigerator would be very great for the next stay. Other than that it was a beautiful stay. We did enjoy the shower, the bed, the view of the city and the television. We would recommend people to have a beautiful day at ROW NYC. ",3/22/19,5
"My husband and 9 year old stayed here for 3 days. The staff were excellent, friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean. bathroom also. We were on the 21st floor, no issues with outside noise. My husband found the room fan noisy but I had no issue with it. Food kitchen next door was fair but there are better places to close by. Excellent location for theatre district, subway is out the front door to the left, just cross the street. Great connections to down town, Statue of Liberty, 9? 11 memorial, central park and La Guardia airport ",3/22/19,5
Hotel has brilliant prime location couldn’t get better. Staff at the hotel are unhelpful and rude check in took over 1 hour didn’t get checked into the hotel until 12:30am. Rooms where of 1 star standard carpets where filthy but bathrooms where very clean,3/22/19,2
I stayed at Row NYC my first time traveling to NYC this week. The location of the hotel is great and so close to many of the places I wanted to experience. The staff was super friendly and the rooms were great! I’ll be staying here again when I go back,3/22/19,5
Wish there had been a fridge to put our waters and leftover cheesecake- but really was not a big deal. All was fine! Great location. Great employees who went above and beyond to make us comfortable. Very clean. Smelled fresh. Comfortable sleep. Good trip!,3/21/19,5
"The hotel is located in an ideal location, close to theaters and timesquare. Since your close to everything you’ll need to plan on $40/night parking. I was working on the east side so I ended up paying $80/ day parking for both locations. Expected for Manhattan. Not much to do at the hotel...but your snack in the middle of it all ",3/21/19,4
"We booked a queen size room with a city view. We were offered to upgrade the room to a king, so we did. The ""upgrade"" room was the exact same size as a full, no microwave, no refrigerator, the view was of a back alley, pressing guide on the remote did not work. We also informed the front desk of ashes on the sil next to the toilet, after cleaning the ashes remained untouched. Most of the outlets were hidden behind different items. Night stand only on one side of bed. Made me glad that we spent most of the day sight seeing and at the zoo, and almost no time in the room ",3/21/19,2
The hotel is so amazing! I loved it! And Junior is so kind and the best one! Thank you so much! Thank you for the hospitality and kindness! Every time that I go to NY I stay in the same hotel... super clean!,3/20/19,5
"It was an excellent experience. The hotel is very nice with a privileged location 1 block away from Times Square, rooms are clean and nice and the best of all is the price. Excellent relation between what you pay and what you get ",3/20/19,5
"Would love my money back, very disappointing. Was my families first trip and the room was not sanitized, the room was not what I was told it would be, from dest clerk dismissed me when I asked for another room and said no.. I was very uspes ",3/20/19,1
Hotel is located close to theaters and restaurants and bars. Restaurant Row is right up the street. The hotel is showing signs of wear and tear. We had some paint peeling in our bathroom but its a great location and a reasonable price if you get discounts. Without discounts it is in my estimation overpriced,3/20/19,4
"Alarm clock was broken. Thermostat didn't work. Room was warm no matter what setting, so we opened the window. Wifi was slow at times. Continental breakfast was convenient. I'd definitely stay at the Row again ",3/20/19,4
"Very lively hotel, Not very modern although its hugh.In a good location easy walking distance to most of the attractions. Beds clean and comfortable. Towels changed every day.A few reception staff quite abrupt. Would stay here again because of location ",3/20/19,3
"I got the deluxe room and even so its size was way much smaller than expected through the website pictures. Besides this aspect, the location of the hotel is the best, right at the heart of Times Square, with lots of restaurant and store options nearby, as well as many main subway lines just at the corner ",3/20/19,4
Highly recommend Row NYC for value (for the area) and proximity to all you need in NYC. major Broadway shows within steps. Nice local bars and restaurants of Hell's Kitchen a block or two away. Tour buses go right by the door and subways a block awa,3/20/19,5
"The best place to stay in the center of everything, just around the corner from John's PIzza2 blocks from Times Square and the subway. They hold your luggage if you checked out and need to walk around some more ",3/20/19,5
Rooms are small but sufficient. all you need is there. What seems a bit strange is the additional payment for the facilities whether you use it or not. I am used to that it is standard in the price of the room or that you pay per use,3/19/19,3
"We booked a room for my son and paid in advance. Booking was in my sons name but on my credit card. When we phoned to reconfirm when our son was on the way, no trace of booking! After three hours of repeated phone calls, being put on hold, being cut off and having to redial and explain all over again, we found the booking under MY name, not his. Not end of story. They then wanted another credit card authorization which we sent but only the front desk could confirm it had been received. Would have been easier to phone the Pope than the hotel front desk. Another two hours of calling and getting cut off - we never got through. Happily, son was checked in when he arrived and had good weekend in NYC, no thanks to Row NYC. Following day had call from customer services apologizing and promising some compensation. Instead we have been billed another $370.00 which we are still trying to check. Guess what, can’t get through. Nightmare - don’t stay here. ",3/19/19,1
Stayed Christmas. The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. The room has everything we needed. There was a water cooler that also dispensed ice just outside the room. It’s close to broadway and Time Square,3/19/19,4
"While not the fanciest hotel I've stayed in in NYC, the rooms were good and clean and the customer service was great. After being snowed out of denver in the ""Bomb Cyclone"" last week, i had to extend my stay and ended up at Row. The check in line was a bit long but it was rush hour so that's to be expected. Shantelle heard about how i was stuck and upgraded my room free of charge and expressed how sorry she was that i couldn't get home. The room was a basic room with a desk and bed, but clean. That and being left alone is all i ever require from a hotel on business and they did just that. Props to the managing group for giving their employees incentives to be better. Your review system made for some of the best customer service ive ever experienced at a hotel and that goes a long way. Im usually not booking my own rooms in NYC for business but I now know that in a pinch i can end up at Row and have a nice room for a great price. Thanks again Shantelle, you made a hard day just a little better ",3/19/19,5
"Our second time here. Dirty, vomit in the lobby washrooms. Some staff were great, but some had total attitude, and the rest of the staff just seemed to allow it to happen. If you think your customers are a pain in the butt for simply trying to check in, perhaps it’s time to change departments to something off the front lines. Once again, and I said it in another review, please don’t act as though you’re doing us a favour and going out of your way to allow us to give you our business. ",3/18/19,3
"Great location, walking distance to many theatres. The staff was helpful. Love the food court adjacent to the hotel. Good selection of food and great atmosphere. Cleanliness of room and linens below average ",3/18/19,3
Answer the phone. Clean the rugs. Answer the phone! Hire more & friendlier staff. The long lines at desk were unacceptable! Had better service from any chain hotel - not expected from a “boutique “ propert! Clean the dust out of the vents. Clean & repair window shades. Don’t charge for breakfast when it’s included,3/18/19,1
Great combination of the value and location. A nice renovation a while back put a modern glass on an older building. Service was friendly and efficient. Continental breakfast was quite generous. Some rooms are small but getting one of the many rooms with a terrific view more than makes up for that.,3/18/19,5
"The price was right for a place to stay in NYC! I knew the room would not be very big, and it wasn't. But it was just fine for a place to sleep and change clothes, etc. - as everyone says, if you are visiting NYC, you shouldn't be in your hotel room except to sleep and shower! This is an older property that has been redecorated. My only complaint is the cleanliness of my room: The floors needed to be vacuumed - there were pieces of white thread and lint all around the room; there were black scuff marks on the walls; there were pieces of black hair on the shower wall and in the tub; there were dust bunnies on the walls along the sides of the bathroom mirror; there was some mold in the caulking of the tub; and the window desperately needed to be washed - there wasn't much of a view to see (rooftops and alleys and other buildings) but the windows were so dirty (on the outside) that it was not possible to get a clear view of the outside. I'm not a neat/clean freak, and can easily be made to believe that some place is ""clean"" if these things noted above had not been so obvious....it tainted my first impression for sure. On a plus side, the beds were comfy, and the wi-fi was good. I'm hoping housekeeping was just having an off day, because I'd like to give Row NYC another chance during a future visit to NYC ",3/18/19,3
"When I arrived at the hotel I had to wait for 30 minutes to check in because of the length of the line. Once I was able to check in I got to my room and it smelled like a sewer. I tracked the smell to the bathroom. I tried to close the smell in the bathroom by closing the bathroom door, but I was unable to get the bathroom door closed. Once I got to sleep the housekeeping staff barged in on me twice, despite the fact that I had hung your do not disturb sign on the door. Also the Internet was really slow and at times didn’t work at all. Also I paid extra for a room with a view and I did not get that view ",3/18/19,2
"Great location if visiting the UN or exploring Manhattan as a tourist. Management either needs to pay staff better or increase the number of staff as my room was not properly clean on arrival. Not the forgotten dust behind the TV kinda dirty (they had that too) but urine stains on the toilet seat kinda dirty. However housekeeping responded quickly and immediately sent someone to clean. The decor is trendy and artsy, though the building's age shows through, specially in the stairwell. Need to repair cracks and replace peeling paint. Rooms are great, especially those for people with disabilities. 2 thumbs up! Linen was worn but clean and soft.The gym is reasonably well equipped, with fruit and water provided. The best staff are in the candy shop downstairs. Very professional and sweet women. Water fountains are a plus and saves on plastic.NB: there is a $11 package handling fee for deliveries to guests. ",3/18/19,3
Loved the location close to broadway and time square. Hotel is clean overall. Rooms are very small. We did not like that our room was only cleaned once during our week long stay. Staff at hotel and Sugar Factory downstairs was very nice.,3/17/19,3
"Location can't be beat -- close to all theaters, Times Square, Central Park and a short subway ride from Ground Zero Museums. Unfortunately that's the only positive comment I can make. The hallways and elevators were dirty at all hours of the day and night leading me to believe nobody cleaned them during my 4 day stay. Rooms extremely small even for 2 people and the view was non-existent -- the back of another building. Beware of additional charges when you check in. ",3/16/19,2
"Bathroom was dirty. Hair everywhere, will tiles looked like someone threw up on them and bathtub felt like you were going to fall through it when you stepped in to take a shower. Location is great. Staff not very friendly. Wouldn’t stay here again ",3/16/19,2

"The hotel was in a great location but was smoky, unknown extra charges to check in-I never understood the reason behind that, front desk staff ok, no queen beds-only double beds even though the website said queen, not enough towels ",3/15/19,3
"The hotel itself is basic, but ok if you are able to sleep through noise (air con and outside traffic). I left my meds on the bathroom shelf and after the first day, one of my meds that was left there dissapeared. I raised it with the hotel and they weren't too allaremed saying, they probalby won't be able to find out what happened, but that if I want, I can raise a complaint. Fortunately, these were only vitamins, although looking like prescription pills, but the hotel staff didn't know that. No surprise, the didn't find out what happened and didn't even get an apology. Something to be aware of ",3/15/19,1
"The Row NYC is not a bad hotel. The layout of the hallways and rooms are a bit cramped, but I've never stayed in a NYC hotel until now, so I'm sure what I should be expecting. Anyway, I quite liked the hotel; very clean, good security, and friendly and cooperative staff. And a bonus, it's a very convenient block away from Times Square! Would definitely visit again ",3/14/19,5
"The information ,from the previous page should be used as -improvement for this hotel due to the fact of the various issues that where noticeabl upon my stay ,at the hotel.The hotel is located in the hart of things but ,the property needs to address this minor things,like the elevator has trash on the floor,the area where you fill water up ,was so horrible,when you pull the door of the water cabinet ",3/13/19,1
"Very comfortable hotel in an excellent location. Close to everything, but far enough away from the Times Square crowds!! Would highly recommend this hotel and do take advantage of the room rate that includes valet parking! ",3/13/19,4
"For the money I spent on the room, it was very dirty. I was surprised. The carpet looked like it had never been cleaned. The room in general was very dirty, however the bedding was clean thankfully. But the coffee was good, and the men at the elevator and doors were great and friendly ",3/13/19,2
The Hotel personnel were extremely slow and check in took over 30 minutes. Valet took forever. Noise outside was ridiculous and prevented me from sleeping. Could hear absolutely everything. Lobby was extremely hot. Room was small but clean and location was good.,3/13/19,3
"Great location for being in the middle of everything, very close to Times Square. There wasn't a lot of space in our room but it was big enough for just using as a base. We had a room with a city view but as we were on the 26th floor and there was a low wall outside our windows we really couldn't see a lot. The bed and pillows were really comfortable and we didn't hear much noise. The room was fairly clean but certainly not spotless. One negative in the room was that we couldn't control the temperature of the radiator as it had a fixed cover over it. It seemed to be on high most of the time which meant we had to have the window right next to the bed open at night. We did ask at Reception for it to be turned down but that didn't seem to happen. Breakfast was good - 2 boiled eggs, piece of fruit, pastry or bagel, fruit juice and tea or coffee but it did get really busy later on making it difficult to find a table. We didn't eat in the restaurant but the food looked good.All in all a good hotel for the price, we would stay here again ",3/13/19,4
"great price and very nice hotel in the heart of nyc. hip, vibrant, great bar. the rooms are clean, contemporary, and no outside noise. if you're for an ideal spot within close proximity, this is your spot. will stay again ",3/12/19,5
"Hotel was a perfect location and price point. Clean & very comfortable rooms with friendly attentive staff. Also a great hotel bar/lounge with awesome pizza & elegant appetizers. Great hotel, highly recommend. ",3/12/19,5
"Although it's expensive, it's very well located around Times Square and Broadway. Its standard rooms are good size and clean. Think first if what you will pay in MTA or transport could be invested in hotel. They will give you just free water and Internet, meals and hot drinks will be up to you or have an extra cost. If you will go to Broadway, you have the best theaters 5-10 min. around. ",3/12/19,4
"We had booked this as a couples couple of days away, I am married to a twin, his twin's wife had never been to New York so I booked this at a very reasonable rate. On arrival a receptionist called Chantelle checked us in, after the men had totally confused her as they are identical. We were allocated rooms 1008 & 1009. Our room, 1008, was outstanding, situated on the corner of the building. we had views up 8th Avenue towards Central Park & across 45th Street, where we could see the edge of the SS Intrepid. The room was large & airy, complete with had a massive bed which was so comfortable, the bathroom had a bath with a shower over it. The staff were friendly & helpful, we enjoyed a lovely evening with the staff in the bar, nothing too much trouble for them. The hotel is in a really convenient position, the hop-on hop- off buses stop just on the corner of 46th Street, 42nd Street - where all the big shows are, and Times Square are within easy walking distance as are loads of places to eat & relax. The Empire State Building, Rockafeller Centre, and most other attractions are easily walked to, and the subway or buses are never far away. We watched the Wales v England rugby in the Pig & Whistle on 36th Street, fantastic atmosphere, staff & service, of course topped off with the Welsh result. We also ate at Patrick's on 42nd Street, outside it said Irish Restaurant, inside we were served the best steaks any of us had had before. My husband & I decided to order a shrimp cocktail, off the starter menu, to have with the steak main course, these shrimps, more like king prawns in size, came on a bed of ice with a choice of dips. They also served oysters, clams, & most seafood all dealt with by a chef openly on the bar. Our sister-in-law thoroughly enjoyed her visit to New York, & the hotel was an excellent choice, we would recommend The Row to anyone, can't wait for a return visi ",3/12/19,5
"Great location and within walking distance to many attractions. Staff was very helpful and knowledgeable of the area. It was nice to be able to use the printers to print our boarding passes before leaving. I liked that there was security by the elevators, I felt safe the entire we were there ",3/12/19,5
"A very nice hotel, very good service, although rooms are a little bit small. Besides that the location of the hotel is excelent, just one block away from times square. Also the service form the hotel staff is excelent and the city's kitchen in the lobby is a great option for a fast bite before you hit the city ",3/12/19,4
"Best value we could find that placed us in mid-town Manhattan. Overall good place to stay, just be prepared for crowded elevators, very small rooms, and no in-room coffee. The Concierge was very helpful, and the ability to store luggage was a huge help ",3/12/19,3
"good hotel in great location if you get a cheap rate (mine was $100). room was small, couldn't adjust temp. get yelled at by elevator man everyday. valet process took 45 min everyday. food options were good. ",3/12/19,3
A short walking distance to all the most popular theaters. Great restaurant choices over on 9th. Also an entrance to the subway is right across the street. Have stayed a couple handful of times over the year and will always come back. Staff has always been friendly. If you are packing in a lot in just a few days this works well. Not super luxurious but very comfortable.,3/12/19,4
This is perfect for those wanting to see a broadway show. We booked to be able to walk to a Wicked. It was perfect. Hotel is clean however bring earplugs as the radiator sounded like kids banging pots and pans in the kitchen! Staff is friendly. The only trouble we had was getting our car that we prepaid valet parking for. It took an hour for them to bring our car to us. Other than that it was great. Would stay again.,3/11/19,4
"Fantastic location and lively, friendly atmosphere. Loved how close my daughter and I were to both shows we saw, phantom of the opera and kinky boots! Breakfast included made startling our day so easy ",3/11/19,5
"The reception who work on 4th around 10.30am who is black and long hair was so unprofessional, acting poor behavior and look down customer as I claimed that I have to wai for 30mins of an elevator from 16th floor and decided to walked she just said ‘IT’S NOT HER FALSE’. I am the royal customers of this hotel ans you can see from the last booking and not expected to receive anything like this ",3/11/19,1
"Arrived at the hotel on Friday afternoon to be greeted with a smile at check-in. The rooms were great, clean,well presented and warm. Had read many poor reviews for this hotel but really have to say we were very impressed. ",3/11/19,4
"We arrived at the hotel around 2 in the morning, and there was only one concierge available with a line of people to check-in, and you could tell that there were a handful of issues coming up since the manager had to constantly come out to assist a customer. When it was my wife's turn to check in after standing in a line for about 10-15 minutes, she was expecting the concierge to not be in a great mood with reason, but to her surprise Shantelle was an absolute pleasure, and the smile she had, made you forget it was 2 in the morning and you just got out of a 4 hour long car ride. When we got to our room it was cozy and very tidy. They even provide you with a to go water pack in case you forgot yours at home, because walking around in NYC you will need to keep hydrated. I definitely recommend this hotel as their customer service is amazing and the locating is perfect. With a 10 min walk you can get anywhere ",3/10/19,5
"Excellent location right off of Times Square and a quick walk to many theaters and restaurants. Deluxe king room was a bit on the small side (It is NYC), but clean and updated. We didn’t really use any hotel amenities. ",3/10/19,5
"Very nice location. Close to theaters,Times Sq and restaurants. Hotel was very safe with securityat night at elevators. City Kitchen was great attached to Hotel, and offered something for everyone. Food was very good. Roxy's Deli was next door and Hot Pastrami Sandwich exceeded my expectations ",3/9/19,4
"Nice hotel. My check in was quick ( due to luck probably) as during my stay it was always a line waiting for check in. The staff is welcoming and ready to help. The room was nice but small even with a deluxe room city view... I can't imagine the size of the standard or superior ones. try to avoid the room in front of the ice machine... The housekeeping was done correctly. the ""city kitchen"" is a plus as you can pick some food when you come back from visit ",3/9/19,4
Very busy hotel. The lobby is constantly full of people. But this is because the hotel is so big and in such a fantastic location. Sometimes it was a struggle to get a lift and at one point we were waiting a good 15 minutes before we gave up and started a trek from the 18th floor. The hotel guests were mostly young but there was no trouble at all. You had to show your room key at night to get into the lifts so it was very well controlled. The stay were helpful and efficient. The rooms weren't the biggest but were very clean. Maid service every day. 3 of us managed in one room and it was fine. Could do with tea/coffee making facilities though. Take your own kettle but hairdryer and iron provided. The little cage on the side of the hotel does the best English tea we tasted all holiday for all you English folk who miss a proper brew whilst away. All in all it was a very good hotel. Location was perfect. Right in the middle of everything u need. All the sights and plenty of restaurants and bars a stone's throw away. The bar across the road called Smith's is a gem. The majestic theatre is about a 30 second walk around the corner. We went to watch phantom one night. It was brilliant. I would definitely go back to New York and I would definitely stay in The Row again. Just another tick in a fantastic New York experience.,3/9/19,4
we spent 3 nights there & the location was excellent on 8th Avenue. we were able to visit places within 5-10 minutes walk & 15-20 minutes to central park. Big Bus was nearby & Times square only 10 minutes walk away. no need for public transport.The hotel had all the facilities & comfort expected,3/8/19,4
"Great location in Times Square. Room was great - security was top notch - ""safe elevators"", food court was quick and very reasonable, many broadway plays within 5 minutes walking distance. Walking distance from the train as well as the bus ",3/8/19,5
"So we booked this hotel because we saw that it was a 4 star hotel in the middle of Times Square and close to a lot of the touristy attractions around New York, when you walk in the lobby it does give you that impression, large open and trendy looking. We arrived very early so our room wasn’t ready so we were able to drop our bags with the bellhops and then we headed out for a bit. Our room was a deluxe room with a city view ( I forgot to take pictures of the room) it was small in comparison to other hotels we have stayed at in the past. There was some mould in the bathroom by the bath. The bed was comfortable enough but a bit too soft for my liking but comfortable enough. They provide you with a water bottle (part of the imposed resort fees) WiFi always worked (again part of the resort fee) there is a gym but it is very very basic. There is a small shop in the hotel which has a few things if you need a snack or something. We didn’t spend any time in the bar really so can’t comment on that, there is a food court area where you can get food as there is no restaurant in the hotel but we didn’t spend any time in there although the food looked half decent in there. People have said the lifts are a problem but we didn’t wait all that long for them when we needed to get up or down although I can see why people would’ve experienced delays as this is a very busy hotel. If you want breakfast though I would strongly recommend westway diner in Hell’s Kitchen only a couple minutes walk from the hotel. Staff were friendly enough and helpful my only grumble was that I waited on a queue for almost 35 minutes to get my room key changed over as there weren’t enough staff working behind the desk but the guy on at the time was doing his best to get the queue down as quickly as he could. Overall it’s an ok hotel but I would say it’s more of a 3 star then a 4. ",3/8/19,3
"The location of the hotel is perfect right near times square. The hotel was clean and reasonably priced for the area. The rooms are small, but that is common in NYC. The hotel staff went out of their way to make sure you get the most out of your visit. Especially Junior at reception who provided great advice for places to eat/drink. He also helped take care of a booking issue we had through Expedia (which he didn't have to assist with). I recommend booking directly on the hotel's website as the rates were the same or less than any other travel site and then you don't have to deal with a ""middle man"" such as Expedia ",3/8/19,5
"my child and I were stuck on 4th floor with homeless population, child was afraid.. the elevator took 20 minutes to get away. shocking experience for child... screaming .. yelling , homeless person running around floor in underwear. When asked people how to get off this floor was told to talk to social workerTHIS WAS THE FIRST FLOOR WE GOT OUT OF ON ARRIVAL TO SEE A BROADWAY PLAY FOR MY 11 YEAR OLD. SHE WAS SO AFRAID...WOULD REQUEST A VOCHER FOR A NIGHT FOR HOTEL TO HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE. Our room was so high up.... then the key did not work.Had to go down down again to front desk to activate key. reqested a lower floor. which manager did do. when we returned from broadway play to retrive our bags there were other people in our room.our room key was deactivated again. my daughter and I got to sleep at 1 am. I kindly ask for a free voucher to come again and have a better experience. 631-377-0806 ",3/7/19,2
"wonderful reception with upgraded room for the occasion, Rita in charge, most helpful. Amanda & Jerry from Brooklyn were really a pleasure to deal with at ROW´s cozy modern bar. priviledged neighbourhoo ",3/7/19,5
"Perfectly located . We were checked in by Junior who took our request for a high floor and turned it into a two windowed lovely room on the top floor , wonderful service . Rooms were clean . Would stop here again  ",3/7/19,5
The staff are the worst I've seen in any hotel ever. I did not get a single welcome when I arrived in the hotel. The hostess at the check in desk was more preoccupied with talking about hair with her associate. As I arrived in the evening tired myself and my wife were the only ones in line and we had to wait until they were satisfied talking about their hair before we could check in. This was the same service we recieved at breakfast. The breakfast was also a joke as its suppose to be be included in the price and when you get there half of items are not included. There is no label that they are not included and they are mixed in with what's included. The habitation was not very clean the corridors were dirty and stinked of weed on the 14th floor. Me and my wife stayed at the city rooms hotel time square down the street the week before for a few nights. The staff was very nice and helpful and there was no 30$ facilities fee and the hotel and room were spotless. Why charge 30$ a night to have the place dirty. I believe the staff think they are the bosses in that joint because they do whatever they please,3/7/19,1
"Check in takes an age, rooms very tired and basic, no draft beers,expensive drinks, only good point is its local to Times Square, Staff are friendly, Kitchens above have no connection with the Hotel and have a good selection of food ",3/7/19,2
"I’ll definitely give the hotel associate Douglas a FIVE star! He is very kind and welcomes customer like a family! He gave me a complimentary room upgrade, which brings my stay to the next level! Great experience thanks to Douglas ",3/6/19,5
"Small room, super tiny bathroom. No fridge and carpet was a little dirty around the edges. Facility fee for what?? Next time I'd spend another $50 and stay in an iconic hotel like Knickerbocker or try the bigger chains. I thought this would be niche and boutique but it was disappointing ",3/6/19,2
"I booked this hotel because it was cheap. Quite a bit less than where I usually stay, and only a block away. Check in went smoothly, the staff was very nice. Upon checking into the room, the first thing you feel is how very small the rooms are. Here's where I say you get what you pay for. At first glance you see the room needs some cosmetic TLC, the veneer on the closets and side tables is broken, the trim has been painted over so many times, it's lumpy. The sheets were clean and the bed comfy, so a big plus there. My remote wouldn't work on the TV, so I had to call maintenance. Then I went to was my face before bed and notice there wasn't any soap in the bathroom, or washcloths. I called and housekeeping immediately brought some to me. The next day, housekeeping didn't replace the washcloths used. Or the next day. Or the next day. It was so odd. One day I would get an extra hand towel, but they would leave the room with no washcloths and one bath towel. Really inconsistent. The room was very dusty. I used the hair dryer to move the dust away from the sink and tub areas. The rooms don't have much insulation, so the baby crying, man on the phone, kids slamming doors, were heard all night long. The morning of checkout, the bill slid under the door reflected $35 per night in resort fees. That was a surprise to me, although likely in fine print somewhere I just didn't see. ",3/6/19,3
hotel rooms are tiny ....bathroom was in need of repair .....also hotel is also a shelter .....would be nice if hotel informed you that the gotel is also a shelter .....the room was so small i could barely open my suit case and lay it on the floor ...lifts are very bad,3/6/19,1
"So! Overall this was such a pleasant stay! The location doesnt get any better than this! It's close to Times Square and just about everything that you need! Honestly, nothing really tops the location. You have a great view, right next to the trains, and honestly the price that I paid was SUPER reasonable for the location, time frame...etc. I was happy with the booking! Check in was smooth. About PARKING, dont drive I would say if you really dont have to. I drove from DC so I Had my car but there's no street parking so expensive lots is all that you have to choose from. They DO have a partnership with one of the lots which was great, made parking $40 for 24 hours which is remarkable compared to the outlandish prices in neighboring lots. But that still adds up.As far as the hotel, uhm, the lobby had a bit of smell the first day. Don't know if I got used to it or if it went away.. Uhm, they have a great elevator system. If you come in at nigth make sure you have you key present to show that you are supposed to be there! The ROOMS. Pretty compact. Not much floor space so keep that in mind when it comes to luggage. There is a tiny closet. The TV is an adequate size and i took AMAZING showers. Great water pressure and temperature. They do have older toilets handles (you know the ones you use your feet to flush??) , the walls in the hallways also look a little older, there was a crack in the wall/glass underneath the TV that could be fixed.. Also, thin walls are real. Getting off the elevator we could hear people..uhmm...enjoying themselves. And then when we were in our room we could hear the kids in the room pretty vividly...but we weren't in the room too much because theres too much city to see to be in the room!! Per all hotels in NYC theres a ton of fees associated but the ROW still has way better deals than the surrounding areas-which is love. The row is cute and chic though. I like the bed and the windows...and then the heater was BOOMING! Which was perfect because I don't like being cold. Didn't have much interaction with the staff but overall they seemed pretty friendly. Overall a great place to stay for a great price! I also loved that they held my bags after checkout.On Sunday not too long before checkout they were cleaning the stairs (not sure if someone spilled something or was it routine) but it was roped off for like at least 45 mins? causing a back up in the lobby-esp because only one elevator out of two was working.But I'm happy with my experience! I would stay here again. Beds were comfy, linen was clean, shower clean and strong...TV great. View great, blinds cute and they had blackout curtains, cant go wrong with that! Thank you! ",3/6/19,4
Our room is not clean especially under the sink. We have a lot of noise during the night. But the location is fabulous and the style of this hotel is amazing. I appreciate the complimentary for the breakfast,3/6/19,2
We came to this restaurant to celebrate Fat Tuesday. 5 dollar Hurricanes and 1 dollar oysters were fabulous. Menu items were varied and featured Cajun favorites. The pecan pie with ice cream was to die for. View of Mount Mohonk also a plus. Staff was friendly and attentive,3/6/19,5
"Ideal location just one block from times square and very close to port authority bus station. Hotel itself is fine but elevators are a joke, waiting times are ridiculous and lobby always seems busy with hangers on but overall couldn't complai ",3/5/19,3
The attitude of the manager was disgusting and the lack of service from security was worse definitely not kids friendly . Plenty of extra charges appear on your credit card when you leave and they will walk in your room when you’re not there which I have a big problem there is zero privacy if you want to have privacy this is not the place. plenty of extra charges appear on your credit card when you leave and they will walk in your room when you’re not there which I have a big problem there is zero privacy if you want to have privacy this is not the place,3/5/19,1
"The hotel adds a “facilities” charge. Ok, why not a boiler room maintenance fee? A fenestration cleaning surcharge? ROW’s fixed expense have to be paid, but don’t intentionally mislead customers about room costs. Secondly, the building uses an elevator dispatch system. It’s woefully bad. Expect wait times up to 10 minutes 4-8 was common all weekend ",3/5/19,2
"Excellent location, great atmosphere! Has everything you need for a great trip. Room is a bit small but location makes up for it. Had a cocktail in the bar and had the best service. Everyone was very helpful and friendly ",3/5/19,5
"Well, I have gotten poor customer service and haven't arrived yet!!! YES I that is correct, Their operator is so rude and dry. Its exteremly hard to get in touch with the front desk. One day i kept calling the operator started tranferring me and the phone would disconnect. The employee's were hang up on me. I finally spoke with a sup on staff he said he name was Steve he took ownership of the issue and upgraded my room. Now, my problem has started again. I am coming into town to celebrate my husbands birthday. Wanted a bottle in the room on ice upon my arrival. Can't seen to make this happen because its to damn hard to get in touch with a staff member. I wanted this trip to be special and great but I'm starting to think i has choosen the wrong hotel to make lasting memories. BTW: I asked the operator to transfer to that Manager Steve she advised me there isn't an employee by that name on staff here at the ROW NYC ",3/5/19,1
"The curb appeal to the hotel is very Time Square. However, after getting checked in and walking in the room. I found stains on the bed, hair and the hotel just didn’t feel clean. I would say cleanliness is lacking here. ",3/5/19,1
"Perfect stay in the ROW NYC, helpful hosts, extremely clean and beautiful place. Very quiet, perfect for taking a rest after a long day in the city. VERY WELL LOCATED :) ... almost in Times Square!!! ",3/5/19,5
"Stayed here for 5 nights and at first, had a little trouble with the room as the hotel was overbooked, so we stayed in a king room for 1 night and had to swap the next day. No big deal but was a pain! Anyway, the hotel is in such a great location on 8th Avenue. A minute walk to Times Square & so close to all the theatres, 10 minute walk to Empire State Building, 10 minutes to Rockefeller centre & 10-15 mins to Central Park. All super easy to get to from hotel. Hotel rooms are nice and spacious. I’ve accepted all showers are just awful in NYC. No water pressure! But still ok to use. Hotel was really good at contacting via Instagram, they always answered which I really liked & helped me with the city tax before I arrived. Nice bar and shop inside the hotel too! The only negative thing would be the lifts. When it’s busy, u can wait ages for a lift. Ages! Again.. annoying but not bad! Could be worse. Overall I really liked the hotel. Fab location. On that alone I’d stay here again! ",3/5/19,4
Have just returned from a trip to new york staying at ROW NYC. The hotel is in a great location. Right next to all the broadway shows and a 5 minute walk to Times Square. We had a room with 2 double beds with a city view on the 21st floor. The view was great. The room its self was small but did the job as we weren’t in it much so it Didn’t matter. The lobby of the hotel is always busy. The lift system was good you would put the floor number in that you wanted and it tells you what lift to get in. The only issue with this was on one morning it took us about 10- 15 minute to get down as it would only let us get in one lift and every time it came it was full every one must of been leaving at the same time that day. We only had breakfast from the bar once it was nice but found it very over priced. The small shop by the lifts in the lobby was also very over priced.,3/4/19,3
"Great place to make as a base for tourist-related trip to NYC. Great deals on rooms, if you time it right. Super clean room and very helpful staff. The food court really made our stay! Excellent breakfast with lots of choices ",3/4/19,4
Very near to time square and easy access to the subway. For the price this was a great hotel. We had left over food and having access to a microwave would have been excellent. The staff were very friendly and the included breakfast was good,3/4/19,5
"Great choice for a boutique hotel in the heart of the action just off Times Square. The room was on the small side as we knew it would be but well designed to meet all our needs so we were quite happy on that front. Front desk quickly sorted small problems like our tv remote not working, and the concierge was super helpful when we wanted to explore Brooklyn. The only small gripe was the central heating, which hadn't been upgraded since the hotel was renovated a couple of years ago - so whenever the temperature dropped below a certain point at night, it kicked in over the whole building and the radiators rattled so much we both woke up each time (at least until we got used to this a few nights in). When we asked about this the receptionist said there was no override function built in to the system, so we had to put up with the noise (and extra heat) throughout our visit ",3/4/19,4
"Very good hotel , worth the money, only a few quirks with the room card that stopped working, I think hotels do this for security reasons, happened the same with previous hotel , and the concierge was not very helpful. Elevators were congestioned at times due to high hotel occupancy. ",3/3/19,4
"We arrived at the Row and check in by a gentleman name Junior. Booked a King bed Deluxe with a view and Junior informed us that due to an incident the night before the Deluxe wasn't available, he quickly found us a room with a Kingbed and took off the resort tax of $40.00. We didnt even ask for the discount. We were happy with this resolution. He even told us of a nice bar down the street to to for reasonable priced drinks. Our room was clean and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. We will definately stay at the Row Hotel again. The price and comfy bed and location was perfect. Thank you Row for making or stay enjoyabl ",3/3/19,5
Bad choice. Do not stay at this hotel. Plenty of better choices in New York city. Long waits for elevators. Had no electricity in half of my room and it took the staff more than an hour to respond to our request,3/3/19,1

I love staying at the Row NYC when I am in the city! It is literally in the heart of everything and only a short taxi or subway ride away from everything you need. I booked with the free breakfast - great way to start the day,3/3/19,5
"The hotel location was perfect, literally seconds to the hustle and bustle on Times Square and Broadway. The hotel decor is modern and clean and our room and bathroom was huge! We wasn’t really expecting this after reading the reviews but we was checked in to a disabled friendly room on the 27 floor with great views. The lifts were busy on times but with 27 floors of rooms, your not really going to have a lift to yourself every time you want one. The staff were friendly and helpful and couldn’t really do enough for you. I know you can’t please all of the people, all of the time but I’m speaking as I find and this hotel suited our needs. Modern, clean, the location was great........ We would definitely recommend!! ",3/2/19,5
I have been coming to this hotel for a long time and it’s always a pleasure interacting with all the staff. Junior was amazing at the front desk ! I did have some specific requests for my room and the housekeeping manager Honey and the housekeeper Bebe did everything possible to make it happen as fast as possible. They made my first night memorable. Thank You ROW,3/2/19,5
I was booked in for a nights stay in the Row hotel in December. Knowing that it was a busy time of year I booked the room back in March. I had received a confirmation email after I had booked & in March & even as close as the morning I was due to arrive. On the day I arrived I was told they were overbooked and that there wasn't a room available for us and moved us to a nearby sister hotel. The hotel room that we were put up in had a single bed and was a tiny room definitely not the queen sized room that my husband and I had requested. The manager in the row said we would be refunded for our 'stay' in the row as well as not be charged for our stay in the other hotel seeing as it was a mistake on their end.I received an email from the ROW afterwards but they initially stopped when I didn't receive my money from the row hotel. I've called and left voice messages and have not heard anything since. I had to call my bank and dispute the amount to which the hotel has also disputed. Be Aware that if you do book into this hotel there's no guarantee that you will actually stay there and may be moved else where.,3/2/19,1
"We were looking for a reasonable price close to the theater in NYC. The Row NYC had the best price for a reasonable room. Here are the pluses: 1) great location... close to the subway, around the corner from the theaters and good restaurants; 2) attentive and welcoming staff; 3) clean rooms; 4) good security. Here are the minuses: 1) small rooms; 2) the bathroom is tiny...the toilet was so close to the bathroom sink, it made finishing your business slightly difficult; 3) the breakfast buffet (included in our package) was pastries and coffee/tea, and a piece of fruit...not really filling; and 4) there is a facility fee of around $30 a day that is really just another way to produce income. For the budget minded to the those seeking a mid-range hotel in a great location...I recommend this property. We will return to this location again and find a reasonable breakfast elsewhere ",3/2/19,4
Stayed here for 7 nights. Reception and bar area look cool and funky but the bedrooms are far from it! Very tired decoration and small (which in fairness is kind of expected in NYC). Biggest disappointment was staff attitude. Too much time focused on asking for tips than actually ensuring good customer service. Much better quality hotels out there even if on a budget.,3/2/19,3
"We stayed for 7 nights from Saturday to Saturday. Check-in was fine. Receptionist was very helpful and polite. Room was fine. Basic, but clean and fine for our needs. The rudeness started from the security. Constantly hassling guests to move from certain areas. We had children with us. Security were telling them off and moving them on for absolutely no reason. There is a huge footfall of guests. You can wait for ten minutes for an elevator as they are so crowded. We then had the joy of storing and collecting our luggage on the last day. Dropping off, the porter basically tells you to leave a tip. This annoyed me. We know how to tip but it got me wound up. Fast forward to collecting our luggage in preparation for the airport, and again he said about tipping. We then took our luggage to the bar area to grab a drink before we left and were told we could not have the luggage anywhere, despite it being out of the way and not disrupting anybody. After the rudeness and general unhelpfulness from the bar staff, we did not tip. We tip for good service. We did not get it. The barman then made a sarcastic comment aimed at one of our party.We had used the bar nearly every night, given tips each time around 20%. We spent a fair sum of money at the bar, at the City Kitchen (which was excellent) plus the large sum on the actual room costs. To have the very very poor customer service was hugely dissapointing. I expected better in NYC and received good customer service everywhere else in the city ",3/2/19,2
"I loved my stay at RowNYC. The location cant be beat! It’s easy walking distance to so much of the city. The room was incredibly affordable for its location. The beds are super comfortable. While the bathroom is small, it was clean and had enough room for all of my makeup. I would stay here again in a heartbeat ",3/2/19,5
"Easy to access location, right by the times square. There are many restaurants, Broadway musicals.The front counter staff was very friendly and helpful. When I visit NY next time, I'll chose this hotel ",3/1/19,4
"This hotel is a great value in the heart of Manhattan. The rooms are as advertised, and the bed are very comfortable. Parking is the ""New York normal"" $80/night, and the atmosphere is great. Walking distance to everything you need ",3/1/19,5
The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The room was fairly clean but there was sticky stuff on the outside and inside of the bedside table drawer and VERY visible mold around the window in the bathroom. Our room was connected via a door to our neighbors and we could hear everything going on in their room. Even if they were not being particularly loud . If I could rate this a 3.5 I would,3/1/19,3
"Stayed in Row NYC for 4 nights was really disappointment with our room as it needed hovered and dusted there was so much dust down the side of the bed and around the sides of the room, there was a bit of biscuit under the dresser when we arrived and it stayed there for 3 days. Can't understand why rooms aren't checked before guests arrive. The lifts where also dirty. On a good point the hotel is central ",3/1/19,1
"We are currently in the hotel, we spent 4 nights and we still have 3 more nights left. The location is very good but there are a few things I can't don't say. The hotel is very dirty in its common areas (elevators and corridors), by night, afternoons, mornings, always; at least at our floor. For sure, the worst thing are the elevators. For example tonight we spent 20 minutes to go up to our floor, it was a surreal situation: people screaming, children crying, queue at every floor and you can't even take the stairs because they are blocked. When you get in the hotel from the hall, you have the impression of a high hand hotel (also the prices gives you this impression) but as soon you stay here a couple of days you will change your mind. While I am writing this review I am in my room listening to the hip-hop music coming from another room.We booked the hotel through booking, paying everything excepts ""additional fees"" while booking. As soon we have arrived at the hotel they charged us 350 dollars more as ""resort fees"" saying that the cost of the wi-fi, water, and gym was not included (this never happened to me before).I am here for my birthday and it has been a good experience in NYC so far, but the hotel has been a big disappointment. I hope that in the remaining 3 nights I have here the situation won't be even worst ",2/28/19,2
"I stayed at The Row for 2 nights it was a pleasure their service was on point.The housekeeping staff was amazing as well, Was tired after partying had the no disturb sign in the morning but was attended too in the evening upon request. It's my new favorite hotel anytime I'm in Manhattan ",2/28/19,5
"I used to love this hotel, and keep returning with the hope that maintenance issues are improved. Still disappointed and with the many hotel options in NYC, will go elsewhere when I am in NYC for business or pleasure ",2/28/19,2
"Stayed here for 4 nights and of February on our 4th visit to NYC but this time with the children. Not one to write bad reviews as I'm not miserable like most on this platform, but when I visit New York again I will be going back to the Amertiania. I'll give it the one for the location and the counter staff are friendly. The room was small, my shower at home is bigger than the bathroom. The room was cleaned once the whole time here, only towels were changes the other time. Quite dirty in the rooms and a lot of dust. Also, the tax per night is a rip off. They say you pay for wifi, gym and the water dispensers. Never once used the gym or the water. The wifi yes, but it costs more for 4 nights than I pay at home for the whole year! The hotel is good for location and that's about it. Find somewhere nicer elsewhere for probably the same cost ",2/28/19,1
"Quiet, clean and pleasant hotel with good facilities for breakfast and an afternoon drink. The rooms are moderately large, beds are comfortable and it is located next to theaters, museums and good restaurants in NYC. We stayed there for 3 nights this time, but we always choose this hotel when we visit NYC ",2/28/19,5
"Excellent experience every time we stayed at this hotel. We go back once again in Feb 2019 for New York Toy Fair this time, surely we had a good stay like always. The people at check-in counter were very friendly. They all tried to helped us to check-in promptly as there was a long line when we arrived. Nice promotional package we got from e-mail so breakfast was included at lobby cafe. Location is so convenient you can walk to many attractions by foot. Like this hotel. thanks ",2/28/19,5
"We have stayed here several times over the last few years, and we love it. Great amenities throughout the hotel, including City Kitchen. The evenings usually have entertainment at District M. It's also very affordable ",2/28/19,5
Certainly not a luxury hotel more like a 2* bordering a 3*. Staff are rude and not helpful in the slightest.On our reservation confirmation it said 2pm check in was told it was at least 4pm before we could get in to our room! When checking in the said the needed a credit card to hold $200 incase we used there services wad not told this at all or it's $250 cash. The lady also tried to over change us for the hotel tax only staying 4 nights tried to charge us for 5 only rectified when challenged. When we got our room it was small and filthy. Would not go back to this hote,2/28/19,2
The room size is so small and does not fit a family of 4 in at all. The room is noisy from the busy road outside all night. It was a great location and WiFi was good were my only positive XX I wouldn’t recommend unless you are a couple for those rooms,2/28/19,3
"We visited NYC this half term (2019).We had a great holiday visiting all the sights. Hotel is a great location, situated just by 42nd street subway. The hotel is on a busy strip in the theatre district parallel to times square. Very noisy on an evening but it is NYC after all! Good central location to commute/walk top to bottom of Manhattan. Good basic 4* clean hotel with good location. Not a luxurious hotel and there lots of group / parties staying there ",2/27/19,4
"The Hotel is so far okay, but not more. It kind of has a standard. What is really annoying are the elevators and its system. You see often big crowds waiting to get up. Heard a lot of complaints about it. Even waiting times up to 5 minutes have to be calculated in for 23 floors...Tip to Hotel management: Get this elevator system renewed/modernized ",2/27/19,3
"Back from a 4 night stay at the Row and after reading several bad reviews on the Hotels facebook page my sisters and I were slightly concerned about the stay we were going to have. We shouldnt have worried. Everything was great. The welcome by Junior on the front desk who checked us in, upgraded our rooms free of charge, reduced our facilities fees and gave us a late check out was amazing. The lifts that people seem to grumble about were easy and fast to use. Our rooms were spacious, clean and modern. Noise can be heard from the street below but this was not an issue for us. The bar in the hotel is clean and if you are lucky enough to hear some of the live music that is played there then you are in for a great night. Our suitcases were kept on the last day until we had to leave for the airport.The hotel is also is a fantastic location, a stones throw from broadway, times square, the bus terminal, subway and some great restaurants. If anyone is looking for a great diner then Westway diner on 614 9th Ave is the place to go. Be prepared to queue!! In a nut shell the hotel is worth the stay. Everyone we met was super helpful and professional ",2/27/19,5
"I was skeptical because of the bad reviews I saw online. However, my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised. Excellent location. Excellent price. The room was on the smaller side but nothing to small. I loved the lobby bar and the kitchen they had on the main floor. WiFi was a little slow in the room but worked. Would definitely recommend. ",2/27/19,4
"It took forever to have someone take our car, had to stay in car while someone went to the lobby which had only one person working despite the long line of people waiting to check in.... The room (deluxe as they advertise it) was terrible and so small we could not fit our luggage in. The heater made the room feel like an oven. Had to change to a two bed room to gain some space. The guy who checked me in was nice and helpful but it is not his fault management at this hotel sucks and change of shift is something customers pay for with inconvenience. It is also a shame that the ads for this hotel and all info provided to booking.com among other websites is hyped up and probably photoshopped rather than a true account of facts. Would not recommend that anyone stays at Row NYC ",2/26/19,1
"The experience was great. We loved the recepcionist. He is a great guy, his name is Junior. So caring and so atrencious, he was really quick, and he knows his stuff, the best experience ever. Thank yo ",2/26/19,5
"We all do it.We rush to trip advisor just before we book our hotels to see what sort of reviews they receive then, upon realising the inevitable that no hotel ever gets a perfect review, we try to pick through the good, bad and downright awful in an attempt to deem whether it’s worth investing our hard earned cash.I did exactly this with the Row Hotel.I booked in June last year so I’ve certainly had enough time stew in my own paranoia as I read a mixed bag of reviews where people raised such concerns as slow check-in waiting times, slow lifts, noisy heating appliances, small bathrooms, loud subways and cramped rooms. Travelling with my wife and nine year old son on our first visit to New York City I can only say I was apprehensive to say the least. Now we’ve just returned I’m going to attempt to allay some of these fears. Firstly, travelling to the hotel was an absolute breeze. Port Authority and 42nd street station are literally in stone throwing distance and even Penn Station is in a nice straight line about 10 blocks down which, lets face it, in New York is easily walkable.The hotel itself is actually quite impressive but could probably do with a touch of TLC. I’ve never quite been in a lobby like the Row where there was never less than fifty or so people milling about, from groups of travellers to school kids to a smart line of airline pilots. This hotel really does seem to cater for everyone. Check-in was a long process but this is a busy hotel and to be honest although I was tired it was quite interesting to gauge the comings and going’s of everybody. Okay, I accept that everyone wouldn’t be happy with this and a few more staff would help, but it’s probably my only minor gripe.We were checked-in by Marcelo, a fantastic representative of the Row who chatted away happily telling us the best places to visit and, most importantly, the best places to eat. Carmine’s and Ellen’s Stardust Diner definitely rated highest and neither disappointed. In fact, all the hotel staff were excellent and only too happy to help whenever we had a query.The lifts. Come on people, it’s just a lift. 28 floors and it’s a busy hotel. I thought they actually coped admirably. The longest we had to wait was possibly a couple of minutes but that was rare and, although we were staying in possibly the busiest city on earth, I feel we can all spare a couple of minutes.We stayed on the 26th floor and I couldn’t have been happier. My best advice is definitely pay for a city view. I honestly felt like Spider-Man being up that high among the New York skyline, we could even see the corners of Times Square. I guess being up that high we were oblivious to the noises below so I can’t really comment on the lower level rooms. Lot’s of people complain about the room temperature. If it’s cold turn the heating on, if it gets too hot, turn it down or off. Not really a lot more I can add to that.Our bathroom was fine. It’s somewhere to grab a shower or bath and use the toilet (New York surely has the most powerful flush systems on Earth). It was clean and functional and did exactly what it said on the tin. Okay, I’m rambling so it’s time to wrap it up.I loved the Row. I was apprehensive and there really was no need to be. I’m not that fussy when it comes to hotels. A bed, a bathroom and a good location are what’s important to me and that’s just what the Row provided. Except it also had that little extra.It felt right.I loved the Row. From the staff to the security ever present every evening checking everybody’s hotel cards, the Row is an absolutely fantastic place from which to explore New York. I wouldn’t hesitate to book again and travelling with a child I had more reason than most to feel a certain amount of trepidation in wondering what my accommodation was going to be like.I loved the Row. What more can I say.  ",2/26/19,5
"The hotel looking at it from the lobby looks great they charge your card at check in which we wasn’t told about but not their fault. The charge does seem high though but its new york nothings cheap. We got to our room and thats were you realise they must spend the budget on the lobby as it wasn’t the best very dated and used, the bathroom door is so badly warped it doesn’t close the bathroom is as big as the wardrobe and the bath was dirty when we got there. Multiple stains on the carpet and smear marks of god knows what on the walls and door frame to the bathroom. The bed is comfy but it took me 2 days to get non feather pillows due to bad allergy. The aircon/heating is like a jet engine being on in the room. Luckily we didn’t spend much time in the room so we just used it to sleep and that was it. The location is great its just a shame about the rooms. Unfortunately I wouldn’t stay again unless they had a decent refurb on the rooms ",2/26/19,2
"Extremely overpriced for what they offer. Rooms are too small, toilet cant even fit 2 people at once.No breakfast. Just a deli. Is this a hostel or a 4 stars hotel? Awful custumer service. Had a problem in my card, went to the reception to speak to the receptionist and he didn’t even look at me while I was talking and wouldn’t wait for me to stop talking, always interrupting me and being very rude. Thats not a 4 starts hotel. I’ve stayed in HOSTELS that are way better.Disappointin ",2/26/19,1
"Room was stone cold when we entered. Turned on the heating and pretty soon, was middle of summer. Complained that no mechanism there to control temperature. Answer from reception: Open window or turn off heating. Noises and bad smell from outside made it unpalatable for us to take the former advise whereas the latter option made us shiver. Also, asthmatic guests are advised to stay away as dust in room might trigger . . . .  ",2/26/19,1
The hotel was nice but the room location I had was horrible. I was near the elevator. I was unable to reach the front desk when I had questions ( the phone rung for several minutes) it took three tries to get through. The breakfast was nice. I only wish the croissant was heated.,2/25/19,3
"always you stay well at ROW, friendly, satefly, best accomodation, in the harth of Manathanif you want... you can eat, drink and stay well... also with the management, that later you find at MSGgood ratio everywhere.... ",2/25/19,5
"Row nyc. Very nice hotel. Very efficient. Breakfast very basic. Fantastic location, walking distance to all major attractions,although i highly recommend the big bus hop on hop off service. Never pay the full price though. Haggle and they will give a better deal. ONLY DOWNSIDE OF HOTEL WES THE HEATING INSIDE WAS STIFFLING HOT ",2/25/19,4
"Stayed for 4 Nights with my Husband, the room was small but spotless and had all essential necessities. The location is perfect, walking distance to many sight seeing attractions! We ate in the City Kitchen on 1 of the evenings and the food was lovely. Also had drinks in District M which has a nice chilled out vibe and lovely cocktails. This is the perfect base for a quick city break as the location is very central and the price was right ",2/25/19,5
"We have just returned from 4 nights at the Row and can honestly say we were dreading what we were going to find after reading the reviews. On arriving we were told that they couldn’t accommodate our request for 2 rooms next to each ( despite email being sent weeks ago ) but in the scheme of things an inconvenience rather than a drama , we were given the opportunity to try and change the following day but didn’t want to waste the time .The rooms are small , very basic and this is by no means a luxury hotel as it is advertised as in some places but they are adequate for a short stay in NYC . I can’t only comment on what we found in the 2 rooms we had .....the bathroom was spotless had plenty of clean towels which were replaced daily , the water was hot and toiletries ok The cleanliness of the room was ok although the dust bunnies were running wild round the edges of the carpet , the room was equipped with a safe ,iron and ironing board and you are supposed to get refillable water flasks/bags but we didn’t and although requested they never appeared .My only real issue involving the room was I had also requested by email non feather pillows on the bed which I didn’t get , it then took 3 further requests and a wait til 12.20 at night to finally get them not ideal when you’ve had a long day traveling and just want to sleep In regards to the reviews I’ve read about this hotel being a homeless shelter yes apparently it is as are many hotels in NYC but not once during our stay did we see any evidence of this day or nighttime and at night you are asked by security to show your room key before you are allowed to use the lifts . This is an extremely busy hotel in an excellent location, it has a great food court which wasn’t too overly priced unlike the bar which is extortionate .The staff we encountered were generally very friendly apart from the man in the luggage collection who walked past us waiting to collect our bags and shut the door on us , it then took a visit to the concierge and asking the doorman to see if he could help us before we were finally able to get our bags. One more thing the hotel tax you are charged $137 yes we did know about this before we arrived but I’m still not sure what we actually paid for ? All in all though for a short break if you don’t mind the lack of luxury of any kind this place is ideal  ",2/24/19,3
"Myself & two friends stayed at the Row NYC for 4 nights! The hotel lobby would give you a good impression by it's looks and busyness. However, the rooms are something to be desired! Our room type was superior. V small - not a lot of space to move around or place your personal belongings... but that wasn’t our main issue. The cleanliness & condition of our room was extremely off putting! Whilst having a glance around our room, we identified pubic hairs on the toilet seat, wrappers & sticky sweets on floor.. There was no evidence to show that housekeeping done a overall clean after the previous customers. Especially after being told to come back & check in properly near 4pm, as housekeeping had not yet been completed. We did make a complaint about the cleanliness of our room & for the inconvenience, a member of staff at the reception desk took 2 nights off our facility fee & reassured us that our room would be cleaned thoroughly... To say the least, this was not the case as all we noticed was fresh towels that had been replaced the next day. No matter how many times we complained... nothing seemed to be done. In terms of room amenities, they’re in need of serious updating! Before arriving at the Row NYC, I read through a mixture of reviews but we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt when booking. I will most certainly not be doing that again! In relation to other people’s comments - the heating & A/C system needs replaced as it is extremely loud... especially when it comes on in the early hours of the morning, WiFi is most definitely NOT high speed as it cut off loads on myself & friends. Lastly, customer services needs reviewed! ",2/24/19,2
"The saying you get what you pay for is true. Booked two stays before and after a cruise. First stay on feb 14- check in is supposed to be at 4pm- we arrived at 7pm to be told-sorry we are overbooked because an airline extended their room block and they have priorities- we have to downgrade your room type, but we will make up for it by waiving your 39 facility fee which is basically the charge for internet! The check on attendant was complaining a lousy her job and the lack of support from management the hole time- talk about a great guest experience! Second stay feb 22- arrive at 8am from a cruise and leave our luggage while we explore the city- come back at 5 get our keys and shower and settle in when we notice our comforter and sheets have blood stains- pretty nasty-guess the housekeeping needs some training. Call to have sheets changed- to be inconvenienced for their error by having to leave the room for 30 minutes so they can change the sheets- sorry but you can’t be in the room while we change the sheets- guess they don’t want you to see any other stains on the mattresses. Manager on duty is useless- his idea of correcting the problem is to offer you two free continental breakfast. How about not having blood stained sheets instead! We have stayed at this hotel about 5 times in the last five years and the two stays this year the place has deteriorated. Lobby is pretty and location is great but the rooms are worn, staff is unhelpful ",2/24/19,1
"Everything was excellent except the WiFi. Which I was disappointed with due to the fact the resort fee you pay for every night says HIGH SPEED wifi. It hardly worked in my room. Everything else was perfect. Beds, location, cleanliness, staff! Thank you ",2/23/19,4
"Very good position close to amenities. Room was adequate but not big. The room was in need of some TLC (see photos). There was a view of some sort of roof top tanks and a sky scraper side on. My partner is an electrical engineer and was baffled by the heating which was so noisy it was disturbing. We were upgraded so can’t imagine what our original room would have been like ! Tiny bathroom but plenty of towels and toiletries provided. We were on the 22nd floor which was accessed via a lift. Receptionists were very helpful. Disabled access was good. We didn’t spend much time at the hotel so the fact it wasn’t great wasn’t a problem to us. The fact it was very central was the reason we chose The Row and that cannot be faulted. However, this is not a four star hotel in our opinion. ",2/23/19,3
"Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in a delux city view room (2 double beds) the hotel is ok but us not a 4 star hotel. Lobby is small & clean, check in was fast enough we checked in early 2.45 & was ok but our room straight away, gets really busy in the evenings. Room was good size for nyc but u needed a good clean, clean bed & towels but everything else was not cleaned properly, everything is well used. Shower was ok but tap in the sink didn't work sometimes. Resort fee isn't worth it we only needed the Wi-Fi so resort fee is madness if u don't need any if the other facilities. We were on the 14th floor & the noise from outside was still bad would be worth requesting a higher floor or paying extra. The good thing about thus hotel is the location, tour bus stops on the main road outside just a block or two down, night time tour goes from around the corner & seen Woodbury common shuttle advertised around the corner. Loads of shops & ast food, restaurants beside the hotel ",2/22/19,3
The hotel is so big you can loose yourself. Mind you most of the hotels in New York are like this. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff when needed efficient. The hotel is in the times Square area and is local for most places on foot!!!,2/22/19,5
"Great customer service, amazing hospitality by far the best all thanks to Gezennia she was fast taughtful, always smiling and willing to help and very professional Thank you can't wait to vist this hotel again ",2/22/19,5
"Hotel confortable & clean. Internet fast. check in & check out no problem. Good service. Hotel is not far from main interest points (Time square, Imperial state building, Broadway, fifth avenue, and many choices for restaurants, coffee... ",2/22/19,5
"This hotel is in a fantastic location for sight seeing round NYC, its a block behind Times Square and within walking distance, if you're an enthusiastic walker, to nearly everything there is to see in NYC. The Hotel is happy for you to have deliveries of food made to the hotel, and will give you a call when it arrives for you to come down which was a great help on the nights we were too tired to go out.We walked on average 23,000 steps a day and managed to see everything we wanted during our 5 days in the City. The hotel is easy to find, and boasts a modern and generally clean decor inside, the rooms are cleaned each day by the maids and there is a bar and restaurant downstairs that we think, are owned by the hotel, we tried to visit the bar one night however it closed before 12am and we missed last call by 30 seconds... There were some cons to our stay:- originally our 2 hotel rooms (7 people in total) where disgusting. There was pubic hair in the bathroom, the carpets where rotten, the beds hadn't been changed, the room was incredibly small, the waste basket was full other peoples rubbish and the radiator and tops where filthy. We were moved rooms, and a $65 dollar credit was attached to each room thankfully.- Rooms fluctuate wildly between hot and cold during the night- as the hotel is on one of the main streets and the windows are only single glazed, you can hear EVERYTHING on the street outside. 6am wakeups became a familiar friend- rooms are far too small to accommodate 4 people, there is limited space for storage of clothes and suitcases. For 4 women under 28, with 4 suitcases and hand luggage I'm surprised we all left with our relationships intact. - bathrooms are cramped and our bathroom door didn't lock - luckily we were all family.- hotel tax is very expensive! $150 dollars for 5 days (we had 2 rooms so it was $300 in total that we didn't factor in) You have to pay on card, plus a deposit that is then refunded at the end. They would accept cash, but demanded that we pay $400 to cover the tax and thendeposit and we would get it back at the end. (which would be useless to anyone at the end of a holiday) so we where stung with the international exchange for money coming in and out of our bank account having had to provide a credit card. - the hotel has a very bizarre lift system, that only operates on a random letter selection so you can't just jump into an open lift. You have to let the lift chose what floor it goes too before you get in. - Wifi is very slow in the bedrooms ",2/22/19,3
"Modern and clean, this hotel is in a great position for visiting the mid town sights and theatres. The room was adequate, but we didn’t spend much time there as we were always out and about. It was very busy and seems popular with large groups of students on school trips, but the hotel is so big there was no noise or disturbance ",2/22/19,4
"I was slightly worried about staying in this hotel after reading reviews on it before arriving however I was very impressed. The lobby is lovely, elevators are quick and easy to use. Security check everyone's key-cards before using the elevators between 6pm-6am. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfy. Bathroom was nice and modern. Maid cleaned the room everyday with clean towels. Simple but clean which is all is needed when in NYC. Location is fantastic. 5min walk into times square. From what I found, breakfast in and around the hotel is expensive however if you walk down 44th street to times square, cross the road and just next to 'VIRGILS' (you will see the sign), there is a Deli which is fantastic and cheap! You might also see a few celebs if you're lucky as it is next door to Times Square Studios which we only noticed on our last day because of all the paparazzi. I would stay in this hotel again if I wanted somewhere cheap and cheerful ",2/22/19,4
Room was very small. Bathroom not thoroughly cleaned before we arrived - dust and dirt in the corners. Great location. Not enough value for the price we paid for Deluxe room with City View. Very expensive for package handling as well.,2/21/19,3
"I'll get the one good point out the way first.... location was excellent, after that nothing positive to say.We were travelling as a group of six, a family of four and a couple. Booked two deluxe rooms in June 2018 only to be told 48 hrs before arrival they couldn't accommodate us so gave us 4 x single rooms instead, had to accept as no choice.On arrival at 9pm ish the queue was very long was very slow, not what you need when you've just travelled for 12 hours. (most of the time I was in reception it was the same) Our 4 x rooms were then spread over three different floors so not practical at all, the air conditioning was something from the 1970's as it was soooo loud you couldn't leave it on in the night as it was deafening, not that it was controllable anyway.I can honestly say that I have never seen so many groups of children on school trips at a hotel before, it may as well be a hostel because this is NOT 4*.Not all staff but a fair few really are not in the correct line of work, the ones 'working' around the reception seem very annoyed by the world in general and it shows! On at least three occasions I felt insulted by them and the way they treated not only me but other guests I overheard them talking to, maybe it's because of the amount of youths staying here they think it's acceptable, well it's not. Every night the noise from the corridors was unacceptable especially when you have young children staying with you.I smelt weed on a few occasions around the hotel which again isn't what you expect from a so called 4* hotel. TAKE NOTE ROW NYC, I stayed at a 3* hotel a few blocks away on my last visit and it put you to shame, it's not all about the money!!!! WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, DON'T STAY HERE, FIND AN ALTERNATIVE ",2/21/19,1
Customer service front desk the entire front crew needs to go unprofessional at its worst I would never go to this hotel again very rude like they are doing me a favor charging your card left and right without my permission when you call for something you jumped from everyone extension not even an extra blanket been asking that for days please do not booked this hotel you can find better,2/21/19,2
"Stayed here from 12 feb for 7 nights , to say that we where disappointed would be an understatement, so where do I start ? Firstly the size of a room we where meant to be in a family (superior room ) well holy god if that’s what they call family !!! Two so called double beds cramped in to a room, and yes I understand it’s New York and you don’t spend much time on it. But really not very practical when you have 2 kids aged 5 and 14 with you , another thing is the bloody air conditioning unit !!! Wtf it has a mind of its Owen !! On /off in the middle of the night ! So loud !!! And another thing the lifts we where placed in a room directly oppressed the lifts there very loud , and another thing is it me or is there a strong smell of weed in the hotel ?? Left our room 2 days running to find a security gaurd standing in the hall way I asked could he smell the weed and he said yes so I asked can he do anything about it as it’s ment to be a non smoking hotel ?? Nothing done about it . All in all very disappointed with our stay here , but on a positive it’s very well located to Times Square and the subway and the bus port authority that’s really the only positive I find about this hotel . ",2/21/19,2
"We stayed at the Row for 5 nights - I chose it because it was cheap, cheerful and smack bang in the middle of Time Square. The room was clean, the hotel was clean, the lifts had a really clever system so that you were never waiting more than a minute or so to get up or down (this is a big deal - you can end up waiting for too long for the lift in other hotels!). We didn't visit the bar or restaurant so I couldn't comment on those. We were really impressed with the room. It was plenty big enough for what we used it for (sleeping and getting changed! ), it had a hair dryer, an iron and a FREE safe!! (I can't remember the last time I visited a hotel that didn't try to charge nightly for a safe!). It also had an ironing board and the wifi was included in the city tax in the room (again, in other hotels you pay the city tax but the wifi is only in the lobby). Not sure why others are complaining about the city tax, you will be charged it in any hotel you visit in NYC. And in most other holiday destinations now too. The travel agent should tell you about this. The city tax was $35 per night so be ready to pay it. It included use of printing from their computers too so if you need to print boarding passes or anything, that could be useful. My only gripe is that the man who checked us in was very mumbly and unclear, and to be honest I felt a bit of an inconvenience to him (which is wrong given his job is to check me in and that's all I'm trying to do....). When I arrived at the desk I said that we were there to check in and asked if I could pay the city tax up front with cash because I had budgeted that into my spending. I thought he agreed at first (mumbling...) but then he tried to send us on our way. So I asked again and he said no it comes out of your deposit on your card at the end. Well... I've already exchanged the fee into dollars and we know I'm staying 5 nights which has already been paid for, so why do I now have to be charged the fee on my card (which I then got charged for via my bank because it was in dollars). Of course this also means when I exchanged my city tax dollars back to pounds, I got mugged on the exchange rate. So I'm not very happy about that Row - in every other NYC hotel I have stayed in, they let me pay up front.Oh and also the air conditioning unit is absolutely ridiculous. It is extremely loud when it first comes on, then it goes quiet, but then randomly kicks in to being extremely loud again - in the middle of the night while you're sleeping! This along side the neighbours yelling in the hallways (hello people, you're not the only ones staying here?) can be frustrating in the middle of the night. Still, I'd rather have one than not. I would stay again ",2/21/19,4
The hotel is in a great location. It is a busy hotel and can be a bit noisy. There is a a decent gym. The beds are comfortable. The hotel is reasonable value for money so all things considered 4 is a fair score,2/20/19,4
"I don't want to be overly harsh on the hotel because for what we needed and expected it was more than adequate but I know that some would expect more. First of all and the most positive thing about the hotel is the location, its next to the subway and only a couple blocks away from Times Square. The bar is nice and you can get a discount if you are a resident. Now for the not so positive, the rooms are small but then again it may be expected for a hotel in this location. Also, be aware of the $36 per night ""resort fee"", this gets you WiFi and water (a dispenser on each floor). Overall if you plan on spending your time out and about but need somewhere that's in the thick of it you won't go far wrong. ",2/20/19,3
Our booking had some sort of mix up between the hotel and the travel agent. We arrived at a time when our travel agent was closed in our country in Ireland and the staff Yanella and Cesar were fantastic!! I was very upset arriving finding out there was a problem but the staff was so friendly and helpful sorting the whole situation that they made a bad situation good. Lamar the manager the next day also was very nice and sympathetic to the situation and made our stay a much nicer one and we could not recommend this hotel enough and will most definitely stay in this hotel again when we come back as it is so central!,2/20/19,5
The hotel is in a very good location near to Times Square. Good Value for money. The room is not huge but that is the norm in New York. The hotel staff we interacted in were very friendly and I would stay there again,2/20/19,4
We like staying there because the family has easy access to Time Square and other attractions with in short walk. This allows me to concentrate on the work I need to accomplish while in town. The only problem is the very loud noises that come from the heating source,2/19/19,4
"Booked the ROW NYC for my wife’s 30th birthday as a surprise for her. I Chose it based on locations, and the various photos they have on their website and Virgin Holidays website , with the lovely lobby and fresh stylish rooms . Arrived at 6pm after a long journey from the UK and check in was swift and easy and the guy checking us in was friendly , when we got up to our room on the 25th floor , I was immediately disappointed . The rooms are tatty , kind of dirty , and drab. * NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTOGRAPHS* even the blinds were covered in dirt. The bathroom door had something smeared on it. The bathroom had moldy yellow bits here and there, dirt under a makeshift vanity type thing. They really need a refurb , as it looks like the budget was all spent on the lobby area . You cannot sleep with the heating on , as the ancient old radiators make a louder noise than a jumbo jet next to you. The doors to the rooms slam shut and shake everybody else’s on your floor. Any staff I spoke to were helpful and friendly . The city kitchen attached to the hotel was very trendy and done some lovely food. And the hotel is in a great position on 8th Avenue for time square , and broadway . Would I stay again ? No. Unless the rooms are refurbished. There are better hotels for the same price . Once your out of the lovely lobby , the rooms are a bit of a “bodge job” . I know you don’t stay in your room much when visiting nyc but when you do come back to sleep/shower it would be nice to come to somewhere clean , modern, and able to have the heating on without sounding like your on an airport runway. Lesson learnt: don’t book somewhere just on their own photographs of the room ",2/19/19,3
"I wasn't too impressed with Row NYC attitude to our delayed flight, we were due to arrive on 31st Jan however our flight was delayed which meant we arrived on 1st Feb, they had already cancelled our room. The managed to find us something (after all we had paid months in advance), no sleep very noising great view though - a brick wall. Very disappointing start to our holiday. We might try again sometime in the future, Row NYC is perfectly situated for Times Square. I wasn't too keen on seeing so many fast food processed eateries however I suppose it is NY, struggled to find something decent to eat within our short time scale. Managed a musical on Broadway, had to be done, Pretty Woman well worth it, great musica ",2/19/19,2
"Very central Hotel, within the theater area and Broadway. I was in february and the rate I got, I find good for the room with view.The check out is very good. You don't have to line up to deliver the key ",2/19/19,4
"Wow what an amazing place. Very busy hotel, large lobby area lots going on. Very easy check in process big shout out to Douglas thankyou realy helpful through out my stay, I stayed 5 nights in a superior city view room (stunning view) room was bigger than expected in NYC staying on the 16th floor, realfs good as you type in your floor number and takes you stight up. City kitchen a food court is located in the hotel has the best food and donuts and coffee and sit and look out at the hussle and bussle of the city streets. Hotel is located in the heart of the theatre district and round the corner from Times Square so many shops, pitza places, restaurants on your doorstep. John pitza restaurant was the best pitza in town, Juniors cheesecake again the best.For a first timer in NYC this was the perfect spot to explore your way around this fun city you can not get lost, of course tipping is expensive you have to tip everywhere in New York , my stay at The Row was faultless helpful staff there for everything you need thankyou I wll be back. Great bar in the hotel with singers and be aware they do charge a tax on check out it was $35.00 per room per night , as you need to leave credit card detail upon check in ",2/19/19,5
Clean room easy check in and out. Convenient location for the business I needed in midtown as well as restaurants and plays. the rooms are always clean. Towels are nice. Bed is comfortable and the mid size room is adequate,2/19/19,5
"When we first arrived for our stay we were greeted by staff member Gezennia C. who made us feel so welcome. We shared great conversation with her; and she made many helpful recommendations for things to do while we were in the city which made us excited for the stay. After checking in, we headed up to our standard room and soon realized upon arrival we shared conjoined doors with the room next door to us which did not bother us however the guests next door were arguing for quite a while and were very loud. We headed back downstairs to express our frustration and were once again greeted by Gezennia who went above and beyond to make our stay better. She made the extra effort to move our room and even upgraded us to a suite which obviously she did not need to do but we appreciated tremendously. Our overall stay at Row NYC was an amazing one that we will not forget, our room was beautiful, the location of Row is incredible (short walking distance from Times Square and Hell's Kitchen area) and the extra effort made by Gezennia make us want to come back as soon as we can! She is a strong part of your team and will help bring guests back to your hotel time and time again! I would recommend this hotel to any one who is looking for a place to stay in the city! We will be back! ",2/19/19,5
Lamar was a great addition to your reamHis experience and reputation will help your hotel achieve the highest level in excellence The front desk crew as great and helpful the housekeeping team was proficient. The security was sufficient,2/18/19,5
"The Row NYC Is In A Great Location, Literally Right Around The Corner From Times Square & Walking Distance To The Theater District. The Hotel Itself Is Very Pretty, & Very Large, But I Do Believe They Are Either Short Staff Or Too Large To Function Properly. The Check In line Was Wrapped Around Waiting Area, We Waited 35 Mins. To Actually Check In, & Apparently There Are Self Check In Computers But No One Said Anything Nor Was There A Sign That States That. There Were 3 People Working The Desk But Only 1 Person Actually Working. if You Are Trying To get In Contact With The Front Desk, Forget About it, They Will Not Answer The Phone. It Took me An Hr & A Half To Speak To Someone That Can Actually Help With late Check Out. & Another 2 Hrs To Get A Tooth Brush Sent To The Room. After I Finally Received Approval For A 1pm C? O, I Guess Front Desk Did Not Communicate With Housekeeping Because The Room Attendant Banged On My Door 4 Times & 1 Actually Walked In While I Was Still Sleeping. The Doors In The Hotel Needs To be Revamped As Well, Being That They Slam && Shake The Entire Floor. I Wouldn't Stay here Again. Hopefully It Would be Better For Other Familie ",2/18/19,3
when first arriving at the hotel it looks fabulous - reception and foyer area where lovely. The gentleman who checked us in wasn't the most helpful when it came to giving us information about the city/ hotel facilities. We where advised that we had been upgraded to to a 'twin double with a city view.' put it this way - if those beds where supposed to be doubles I'd hate to imagine what a single bed looked like - the city view i'm sure would have been lovely but the windows where that dirty you couldn't see a thing out of them. the room itself wasn't good - clearly not been deep cleaned in a long time - the wardrobe consisted of a curtain and the bath was only big enough to fit a toddler in there. However we where not intending on spending a lot of time there so it didn't matter. The problems came at night - i have never stayed in a room that was so loud - multiple times through the night the 'radiator' would fire up and it literally sounded like a tractor had just started up next to you. again - not much we could do about this. on the 2/3rd night we had teenage boys in the room next to us - they kept us awake most of the first night they where there so on the second night we decided to make a noise complaint to reception at about 1am.. followed by another at 2:30am.The hotel didn't send one member of staff up to talk to next door - instead we stayed awake until 4am listening to them shout. The next day when i asked to make a complaint about it - the woman on reception actually ignored me twice then said she would send someone over - after waiting 25 minutes i realised she wasn't going too.the maids also knock on your door at 8/9am every morning regardless of if you have put the 'dnd' on your door and have bad attitudes if you ask them to come back later. One day we got back and only one of out beds had been made and they had just left the other one. over all the hotel was not a good experience - however city kitchen (restaurant connected to the hotel) was really nice,2/18/19,2
"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel! Very centrally located, very comfortable room with a nice view! Cannot fault the hotel at all :)We would stay there again one day!! Loved this hotel! Loved NYC!! ",2/17/19,5

Thanks guys see you then in September ",2/17/19,5
rooms were extremely dirty. bathroom had dirt and hair all over the floor and the tub. stains on the walls. corners full of dust. light switches sticky and black in crevices. cockroaches in the hallways,2/17/19,2
Boutique meaning small but dumpy ? Then this is the place for you. We had to spend a night here as it was the only place in town ! Got a small decent room on the 8th floor which was ok but sounds travels like crazy in this hotel . Spend the whole night awake as there were weird people next door partying with the TV on full blast watching ball games ! Too scared to knock on their door or call the front desk ! Never again . Go at your own risk . Good luc,2/17/19,3
"Had the best stay ever at Row NYC! We had a lovely spacious room on the 26th floor, an amazing view of New York and had a lovely comfy bed, clean room and amazing service by everyone that worked there. The hotel is in walking distance of Times Square and loads of other amazing places to visit whilst in NY. Will definitely 100% be back to New York at some point this year and we will be staying at Row NYC again. Brilliant holiday xx ",2/16/19,5
Easy to get to..close to everything. Just wish suites had king size beds. Stay here whenever we go to NYC. Pleasant staff at front desk. Helped make our stay for my wife's birthday even a better experience,2/16/19,5
Good service is measured in extraordinary situation. When you give goid service because it’s written in the terms of the reservation it’s your duty but when you’re being sensitive to your customers in unexpected situations that’s a good service in you’ve been inconsiderate and very strict wheelchair I missed my reservation in 24 due to a flight cancellation caused by a storm. When I got to the hotel after a long night ar the airport and asked fir a room for just a few hours you refused even though I know for a fact the hotel wasn’t fully booked! But you sure didn’t forget to take a 100$ deposit from my credit card without my permission even though never checked in,2/15/19,1
"I absolutely love this place! No where I’d rather stay but here when I come to New York. The location is amazing—walking distance to everything and also has the City Kitchen connected with amazing food. The service is amazing. We had a few issues with our shower upon checking in; however, the lovely lady named Christina at the front desk was able to fix it and help accommodate us. The housekeeping staff is also extremely detailed and really takes their time in making your stay comfortable. Alison really took her time making sure that our bathroom was spotless ",2/15/19,4
"Location is near theatres and Times Square. Good value for that reason alone. Room was clean; bed too soft for us. Corner room had great view for traffic/people watching. But, had radiator in bathroom which would have prevented anyone over 5'5"" from sitting comfortably. Then, again, tall person could reach towels over tub. ",2/15/19,4
I found the staff very friendly and helpful especially while stranded due to inclement weather. I had forgotten my charger for my phone and a very kind custodian lent me his charger while he was on shift.,2/15/19,4

When booking the room online we were giving a price when it came out of the bank before our Stay it was more than oringal price so I called and they told me that was including everything I wouldn’t be charged anymore at the hotel. Once I got to the hotel a hold was placed on my card for 178 more dollars and I was told the the 100 was for damages and the 78 would be charged for room fees when I went to the front desk for check out the female working check in was the RUDEST lady I have ever dealt with and argued the entire time even once she got the manager she was still rude right in front of her and she didn’t even ask her to walk away the dog worst customer service I’ve ever experienced,2/14/19,2
It was cold this weekend but hotel was in great location. Check in and check out was really quick and convenient. Rooms are small but if you are here just for sightseeing and partying okay. I had a great stay and would recommend this hotel,2/14/19,4
"Hotel is in an ideal location for Times Sq, the subway, Broadway and the Port Authority. Rooms are slightly dated and on the small side, but it’s NYC so expected. Good WiFi and pleasant staff who were helpful when I got parcels delivered. I asked for a kettle to be brought to my room and they had one with me within ten mins. Would definitely stay again. ",2/14/19,4
"Room was ok, basic but just what you need really as you're out and about all day. bathroom extremely small. Located on Broadway so not too far all local sights etc. The hotel appears to have permanent residents living in certain parts of the hotel, never really caused any issues at all. Air conditioning unit was an absolute nightmare as it came on intermittently and was fixed over 4 times, very prompt service but never actually resolved situation, far too hot in the room despite it being -14 outside!! Only downside of NYC now is the really expensive city tax people pay now.. spoils the holiday really as it was over £50 for 3 nights!! Be careful. ",2/14/19,3
"Row NYC is in a great location. The hotel is clean, quirky and staffed by mostly cheerful, helpful staff.The price is reasonable. I was there on a special so price was exceptional. There is a gym though I never had the opportunity to use it this trip. In the past I have enjoyed the space ",2/13/19,4
Christina S. is the best!!! She was super helpful and informative during my stay. The room was very nice and clean. In a good area of nyc. Good food and service at the hotel and the cafe upstairs is great,2/13/19,5
Great location. Great atmosphere. Staff were very friendly. The room was average size but did not take away from the experience. Will definitely recommend this hotel to everyone. Enjoyed events at District M as well.,2/13/19,5
"Staff was rude, unhelpful, and unfriendly. Room was clean-ish, but overpriced. Do not recommend. They do have a lot of traffic in the lobby, which I assume means they have a lot of guests, but obviously they can't handle their high guest volume; just because a lot of people stay there doesn't mean that it's of good quality. Never again ",2/13/19,1
"Myself and my mam stayed in a superior twin room for 4 nights. Beds very comfortable. Only fault was the radiator/air conditioning unit would make such loud noises at night, at times waking us up. No kettle in the room also. Apart from that hotel was perfect. Close to absolutely everything ",2/13/19,4
"Customer service was terrible! The staff were very nonchalant about the lack of their establishment having things that worked. Like they’re charging these resort fees, as if to say they offer more than there competitors but that wasn’t the case ",2/13/19,1
Wonderfully located weekend getaway! The value here was well noticed. Everything was clean and well kept. Has a very true to NYC feel and use of space. The staff was courteous and helpful.

Check-in was quick, the room was available ahead of schedule, food at the bar/lounge was delicious and all staff members we encountered were helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. We had a very pleasant experience at the Row. You won't be disappointed ",2/12/19,5

The location was perfect. The room was cozy and a great value. The staff was very friendly and caring. I did have an issue with the room key not working and Mariel at the front desk did everything she could to fix the situation quickly. Mariel is an asset to the hotel. Thank you,2/12/19,4
"1st time visit to America for our honeymoon. The hotel was a good location into the centre of where we wanted to go. When we went for a drink in the bar the man who was serving didn't really take notice of me, I asked for a glass off red wine and a coffee, he said ""which one"" in such a dull tone while talking to another couple happily and completely ignoring me. The wine was fine when we eventually got it but the cappuccino was scolding hot so had obviously burnt the milk. The most annoying thing was is that I had messaged in advance saying it was our honeymoon which is a very special time and it was our very 1st time to America and they replied straight away saying that they would take care off it. They did ask my needs and I put it in their hands and trusted them. When we arrived to the hotel and checked in we went up to the room there was nothing. I was so disappointed as this being our honeymoon. So basically the hotel is good for destination but that would be it for me to be honest ",2/12/19,3
It’s all about the location. Great place to stay and close to Time square. Staff were sound and friendly. We upgraded to a city view and got the 27th floor looking towards the Hudson. Not sure that was worth it but was nic,2/12/19,5
Stayed here for a week in February. Great hotel. Very centrally located + easy to walk to the many attractions of New York. Stayed on the 15th floor away from the lifts which was very quiet. Rooms not large but had 2 double beds + were cleaned daily. Food court was great with something for everyone. Especially the doughnuts! Easy to check in + left luggage was great to use on our last day. A very busy hotel 24/7. Would recommend,2/12/19,5
"The hotel is in a really great spot - close to all theatres, Times Square, public transport and a 30 minute walk to Central Park. The bedrooms were a reasonable size for Manhattan and the beds were comfy and the bathroom was small but functional. Towels were changed daily - but that was it! The decor and furniture is very ‘tired’ and badly in need of refurb. The beds were not clean under the sheets. The heating and fans are very noisy and blew air every two hours during the night which you could not control. The reception area, lifts and corridors are dark, smelly and creepy. Also some rooms are used for homeless people which I respect but did not expect - particularly at the rate of tax in this hotel. The location of this hotel has so much to offer - it just needs investment in lighting, painting, carpets and furniture. As well as much improved cleanliness standards ",2/12/19,2
"i have stayed in this hotel a few times before and i have notice the deterioration, the elevators are always dirty and the rooms are not pristine. Always happy with the staff and the way they respond. Need to improve the internet quality ",2/12/19,3
"Do a regular maintenance check prior to checking in guests. You should have somebody ready to receive calls from the room service. Wish you have a ready available bottled water in the room. The hallway of the room should have light source, its too dark, lighting. We could hardly see what is inside the walk way closet ",2/11/19,3
"We arrived and tried to check in, only to be told our booking confirmation stating a twin standard room was really a double. This wasn't acceptable, a twin room in any hotel in the world means you have 2 beds in the room. After a quick call to our travel agent, this was sorted and the rather unhelpful first person we saw at check in was replaced by someone much more helpful. We eventually agreed to a double for the first night and a twin (upgraded) for the remaining 6 nights. They also agreed to only charge 4 nights not 7 for the facilities fee. For the rest of the stay, the room was clean and comfortable. Didn't eat or drink at the hotel, it was expensive. A short walk in to Hells Kitchen gave more variety and cheaper food and drink at the literally hundreds of establishments to choose from. As for New York, I loved it, amazing city. ",2/11/19,4
"I chose ROW NYC for the third time because it's very convenient for me as a theatre-goer. The hotel has its own style with a lot of things for the convenience of the guests (the internet access, the fitness facility,etc.) ",2/11/19,4
Had an amazing experience during my stay. The room was clean and had a good view. The staff were nice and helpful. I definitely would recommend this hotel. When I’m in the city I definitely will be staying in row hotel.,2/11/19,5
The location is top notch if you want to be close to Times Square and all the theaters.The hotel itself is very large and there are many people in the lobby all the time.The beds are very good and the room was nice,2/10/19,4
"After reading some pretty poor reviews prior to travel, it's safe to say we were a little apprehensive about staying at ROW NYC. I'm so pleased to say we had nothing at all to worry about! Rooms - We booked a double double and it was spacious, bright and really clean. Housekeeping tidied every day whilst we were out. We also had the most amazing city view! This was the biggest room I've ever stayed in in NYC, and the beds were so comfortable I wanted to bring mine home with me. The bathroom was small but clean, with plenty of hot water each day. Location - we could see the bright lights of Times Square from our room, just one avenue away from the hotel. You're in walking distance to all of the tourist attractions. On the street of the hotel there are bars and restaurants, and amazing pizza places. Never stayed in a better location in NY! Hotel in general - the entrance area is lovely and modern. They have a great bar and a place for food called City Kitchen. It's a great place to sit and people watch the street below. They have a clever little system for the lifts too, where you key in your floor number and it tells you which lift to get. It makes everything really quick! They also have security by the lifts on night times to check your room key, which made us feel safe. The check in guy wasn't particularly welcoming and definitely didn't have a smile for us, but that was literally the only tiny negative we experienced. So a huge 5 stars for this gem of a hotel - we can't wait to stay again ",2/10/19,5
"The situation is it best value, almost in Times Square. Rooms are a little small, but comfortable. Wardrobe is simple, just to hang clothes, no shelves, but you have drawers in room you can use. Bathroom correct. And room it´s clean in general. Just heating was little high and when you try to low temperature you got cold, little complicated to reach a medium point. But i'ts a very nice place to stay, I will come back if I coul ",2/10/19,4
The Row is one my favorite hotels when I visit NYC. It is right on Times Square. Access to restaurants and night life. Plus it has the multiple food spots in the property. The only thing I don't like is the extremely small bathrooms,2/9/19,4
"Positives:- Location. 2min away from Times Square, could not be better for a city stay. Everything is close and easy to get to. No other positives. Negatives:- Rooms. Don’t get fooled by the OK looking lobby, the rooms are a total dump. Please see my pics. Horrible. What’s really bad is not just that everything is really old and needs renovations, but even when the work was done it seems it was done by a 5-year-old! (see example of that in one of the pics, see how badly silicone put around the bath, that’s definitely not done by someone who knows what they’re doing) … We travelled with friends, so it wasn’t just our room like that.- Temperature. We were there in January during a polar vortex, but we felt we’re in the middle of a Sahara Desert in July! Telling reception about it produced no results. The heating even on the lowest setting was so high that we had to slightly open a window just to be able to sleep without sweating.- Staff. People working at the front desk and their manager – none of them should work in a service industry (we encountered 7-8 staff across different shifts). They weren’t rude per se, but they really made you feel like you’re bothering them. They were very uncaring, just not bothered, like they hate every second of the job they do. You had to really drag out any information you need, e.g. asking what is the quickest way to Times Square or where is the water dispenser – instead of giving a proper full answer, you just get short quick answers that only require further questioning (e.g. instead of saying “come out of the hotel, turn right, then turn left on X street, then turn right on X avenue and you’re there! ”, the answer was “there” while pointing in a general direction). Also, twice overheard staff complaining to each other how much they hate working here. Not something you want to hear as an excited guest the minute you walk in to a hotel. Although, I have to point out, that the only happy, pleasant staff we encountered were cleaners on our floor. We met 4 different ones during our stay and all of them always said hello to us with a big smile and wished us a good day. Not once did we hear anything even remotely to a “have a good stay” from lobby staff.- THE WORST THING. But all of the above could have been sort of forgotten purely because of the location, as when you come to NY, you don’t come to spend your days in the hotel…but! What was really awful is that they have a hidden “facilities fee”, that you MUST pay, there is no choice to opt out… and it is $35 per night (yes, per night, and not per stay!) ON TOP of your usual hotel room fee. They tried to promote it at the desk as you get so much back – the gym, the WiFi, the phonecalls from the room, discounts in a few local shops… wow! How generous of them… These are THE BASICS in most hotels around the world! To make it worse, the world’s most expensive WiFi was really slow (e.g. it was taking 1-2 minutes to just load 1 photo on WhatsApp) and it was constantly dropping off (i.e. if you play a game on your phone that needs constant internet connection, every two minutes or so connection would disappear and the game restarts). This is a perfect example of a management/owner who clearly only cares about making money and not once even considered the experience of a customer. I would never stay here again for sure. And with that hidden charge on top of your daily rate – you can find so many better options in NY ",2/9/19,1
Water between the plastic cover and the hard bottom of the shower. it was difficult and potentionally dangerous to take a shower. Was reported twice. was not fixed when we left after 6 days.The area below the desk was very dirt,2/9/19,2
"The location of the hotel is excellent. Close to subway and bus stations. The rooms have enough space for a few days stay. The bed was comfortable. But the bathroom walls were not clean. The carped did not look clean either, so bring your flip flops ",2/8/19,4
"Check In - We arrived about 10pm and there was a que to be checked in there was only 3 staff on reception and there was about 10 different people waiting to check in. Whilst waiting for o check in you can here the band or singer that was performing in the hotel by the bar, which was quite loud whilst waiting and being tired doesn’t help. When it was eventually our time to get checked in the guy was very friendly and helpful in explaining everything about the hotel, I was told we would be to one side of the hotel on the 23rd floor, was unhappy about being opposite the lifts. The room was compact and the bathroom was more compact very tight with two people moving around in the room plus was there was air on. I know some who had stayed here before and they said it was amazing well I was sadly disappointed overall with the hotel as I was only staying two nights it was not to bad.The hotel itself it in a good location and it is easy to get to place ",2/8/19,3
Very Good situated In the middle of Times Square with activities allover day and night. check in advance bout taxes that can make it more expansive. High security and fast elevator. Very kind employees who takes care of you at the receptions desk.,2/7/19,3
"Location is perfect. Close to Time Square and subway to anywhere you want to go. I believe I was not lucky with reception attendence at first. Room and bed was great. We choose queen size by extra charge. A friend stayed in a double bed room. It was not a very good experience. All too small for 3 people. But besides all, I think I would stay there again ",2/7/19,4
"First of all before I write my review , a couple things before i should mention that you will definitely want to think about. First of all, NYC is potentially the most iconic city in North America and possibly the world. This translates into massive massive amounts of tourists so if you you plan on looking for a vacation with young children, I strongly suggest waiting until they A) are older to walk at the same pace as you without holding hands as B) are able to appreciate and understand the history behind this city. It is very easy to lose sight of kids and it can be very difficult to get around with strollers etc. Also, finding a bathroom is almost impossible unless you plan on eating there or buying something. Which is essentially what my wife and I had to do when we were exploring. If you plan on taking the hop on/off, remember the 2-2.5 hours they advertise is WITHOUT huge delays, and if you plan on going during the Christmas break like I did, Times Square was absolutely insane on the weekend before New Year’s Eve. Next , if you plan on staying in Times Square , BRING EAR PLUGS!!! We stayed on the 24th floor ( second from the top I believe) and I could hear honking almost all night as clear as day. Also , be aware that you will be paying “Resort Fees” . This hotel is among the best values in Times Square but be sure to shop around and include the resort fees as this one has higher fees than many others in Times Square. There’s no complimentary breakfast so factor that in as well. Also, everyone in the hospitality industry in New York is looking for a tip. This shouldn’t be a surprise. If you aren’t going to tip, it’s going to show. $1 per bag minimum, doorman hailing a cab is at least a $1 and if you want your rooms looked after , I suggest leaving the cleaning ladies $3-5 a day. That’s just how it is. If you don’t want to tip, don’t go to NYC. I’m telling you Manhattan can be very expensive... food, entertainment, tipping ....the only cheap thing I saw was those 3 for $10 T shirts! As you have read many times, the location of this hotel is very good. 15 min walk ( 7 blocks I think ) to Rockefeller Plaza, and 1 block to Times Square. It’s an older hotel but that’s why it can charge a what it does and people pay it. Yes , I have stayed at higher end hotels than this one but I had to pay a lot more for them and really didn’t get to enjoy the room much .I remember staying at the Hilton and some couple was arguing next door to the point where we had to call front desk multiple times and finally they were escorted out. So to me, s*%t happens everywhere and I don’t want to be wasting all my valuable time in my room . It’s NYC for Pete’s sake! Every available minute you have needs to be spent exploring the city! I thought it would be a massive line to check in but we got in at around 10 and it was a breeze and a super nice Latino lady greeted us. Although our room wasn’t ready which I didn’t expect , the baggage guys downstairs watched our luggage and we explored the city and came back to check in at 5. I was expecting a crazy line up for a Friday during the holidays but I waited about 5 minutes. I’m not saying I don’t believe the people complaining about the customer service entirely, but every time I went to the front desk , I had a different person and they were all polite to me so I do have to wonder if some customer may exaggerate a little. I’ve also read reviews where people said the front desk phone rang at least 15 times , but I called down twice and both times they answered on the second ring .The elevator system is great. They are pretty tight, so large people may find it frustrating but there’s quite a few as this is a very large hotel. You type in tour room and it tells you which elevator to board.The lobby is modern. There are computers to print boarding passes, a bar ( District M) that serves breakfast in the morning and drinks later on. Also the food court was pricey but convenient . You must try the “Dough “ donuts! So many great flavours but get there in the morning when they are fresh!! However there are so many places to eat across the street and Hells Kitchen is a block over for a fraction of the price. There’s a gift shop in the lobby as well as a candy store so there’s lots of amenities to keep you busy if you are waiting for anything/anyone. Expect the rooms to be much much smaller than any other city in North America. It’s MANHATTAN! , PEOPLE!! ; every inch of real estate is at a premium. I shake my head every time I read people complain about the room size. However , we were pleasantly surprised with our room . I’d like to thank Karina for making sure our room was clean. I was worried after reading some reviews but we were very pleased. The beds were super comfy as well! However if I had to find things that couldn’t be improved on , I would say that the hallways need more lighting ,there needs to be a corner attachment used on the vacuum for the spots between the nightstand and bed and the room temperature was a little hard to regulate but the that could be because we were pretty high up( heat rises). Also, It think most hotels have Keurig or Tassimo machines in them these days or at the very least a coffee pot. I need my morning coffee ASAP and like to drink it while I’m waiting for my wife to get ready. Although we didn’t need a mini fridge , it would have been nice to buy some soda or beer and keep in there to save a little . I think for those people who just need to have that extra bit of space for luggage etc, I recommend paying to upgrade at the time of booking just for peace of mind. It’s cheaper to do it at that point than later on .So all in all, if you are on a budget but don’t want to be in a dive or a hostel, I think you will definitely see the value in this hotel. ",2/6/19,4
"I stayed here for 7 nights in January and never had a problem. Actually, I have been staying here since 1986; both as the Milford Plaza and as Row NYC. For this trip the desk clerk was outstanding, I had a very nice room with a view of the Hudson River, there is a bar area on the lobby level, and the hotel is attached to a food court. Location is outstanding, with 13 Broadway theatres within steps. I saw 11 shows and did not have to cross the street for 3 of them. The housekeepers were thorough and checked to ask if I needed anything further. I will stay here again.....and again. ",2/6/19,5
"The location of the hotel is excellent. There is nice white, clean linen, plenty of towels, soap and lotions. The size of the room is sufficient; the internet works. The carpet in the halls absorb noises. The only aspects that the hotel could have improved on: the carpet needed to be vacuumed and the repairs were visibly done by a non-professional. The elevators have a special system: one needs to type in the floor and wait for a letter to appear; that letter represents the elevator which will take you to the requested floor. If you do not understand the system, you risk to wait a long time!!! The lobby is huge and noisy (a bar is located on one side), the reception looks small and far away, so the whole picture is not cozy-looking. But it is a good hotel overall ",2/6/19,4
"An honest review of this hotel.... if you want disgusting service, grubby accommodation and even worse management then this is the hotel for you. The other trip advisor reviews were very accurate when they describe the welcome you get when checking in... after a full day travelling late at night being told to “ wait whilst I finish what I’m doing “ was far from ideal. I was genuinely amazed at how rude we were spoken too... after checking in and having to ask how to get to the room ( don’t expect any help or directions, or come to think of it eye contact when checking in) we got to our room... what I will credit with is the creative imagery of the rooms... that photographer has some impressive skills to make rooms that have disgustingly dirty carpets and bathroom that had clearly not been cleaned in quite a while look good. The whole place had a dirty smell, the bathroom was so small you couldn’t physically do a full 360.... the next day we noticed our toilet was leaking quite badly so we went down to reception, if we thought the welcome the night before was bad we was in for a real treat with what followed. Again to be spoken to in the most disgusting manner which got no better when the manager came out. We returned to a room where the bathroom or room hadn’t been cleaned despite flagging this to the manager, the same time we had flagged to the same manger that when we approached the concierge to book tickets she raised her hand to our face, told us to wait whilst her and her colleague discussed her weight loss... also the hotel really needs to work on not only the cleanliness and maintence of the rooms but also the lifts, we had several times of sharing the lift with left over pizza and burgers on the floor! To summarise don’t waste your money on this hotel... I rarely write reviews but I couldn’t not with this hotel as I feel fellow travellers should be warned on the disgrace this hotel is ",2/6/19,1
"Arrived at the hotel late in the evening to be greeted by a unfriendly member of staff , who kept us waiting while he carried on doing something while talking to another member of staff like we were not there. Finally got checked in got into a dirty lift and then a small room with a grubby looking bathroom. Nothing like the pictures on the website but it was late so we just went to bed. Next morning went to speak to the concierge regarding passes and she just put her hand toward us and said hold on and then started a conversation with her colleague about losing weight , yet another rude member of staff No customer service when she did finally speak she was not at all helpful. As we only here for a couple day we just went out. When we got back toilet was leaking. Room not cleaned and when spoken to the manager yet another person not caring that a hotel guest was unhappy. If you want to stay at a grubby hotel with rude hotel staff but if you want a clean hotel with clean rooms , clean lifts and generally nice friendly staff look for another hotel ",2/6/19,1
"An amazing experience and excellent location. I couldn't believe that we were just a block from times Square, the city view, just the Air conditioner made noise when it started to work but we get used to ",2/6/19,5
"I stayed for 4 nights and it only costed 600 USD. The hotel has a really clean and well-equipped gym, and the room was big enough for two people with a nice city view. The hotel is right next to a subway entrance and it is so convenient to travel around. Not the fanciest nor prettiest hotel, but for 600USD, this is a VERY high quality stay ",2/6/19,5
"We arrived on 29 January to a very cold New York but a warm welcome at the Row. Staff were friendly and the we were impressed by the modern style of the foyer. Lifts worked perfect for us very fast.Our room was on the 10th floor and I was pleasantly surprised with the size. It was large with two double beds and plenty of wardrobe/suitcase space. The room was fine although it did require a bit of updating. The bathroom paintwork was a bit slap/dash and not as sleek as everywhere else. It was also a bit dusty. Saying that the room was serviced everyday when we were out, a great service for our 4 night stay. The beds were so comfy we had a great sleep, only issue was the noisy air con/heating unit in our room. The first night it was on and off, it was very noisy. Staff were willing to move us which was great but we declined as the next night although it did come on it wasn’t as bad. I think as the temperatures outside got higher the unit didn’t automatically come on through the night. We knew about the fees so we’re fine about that. I think they are a little high but we did use the discount pass you get with the room key. As for New York... wow! We loved it and this hotel was in an amazing location to let us explore! ",2/5/19,3
"Our air-conditioner made such a loud noise every time it turned on and off, that we had to unplug it completely at night time. The ""off"" switch on the thermostat also did not work, so I had to physically unplug the unit from the wall every night before we went to bed. After the Engineer came on the first night, he assured us that the problem is not specific to our room and that all the rooms in the hotel have this problem, as it is very old air conditioning units used in the hotel. I will attempt to upload a recording of the sound on Trip Advisor soon. My wife described the sound as a bag of corn that are being hit by a fan, every single time the air conditioner turned on or off.We had a Premium room, so I i don't want to know how bad the air conditioners are in the other rooms.It was extremely unpleasant to sleep without an air conditioner in the same week that NY experienced one of its coldest temperatures ever recorded. At least the bedding was warm, but I definitely won't be returning, especially not during the summer, as you won't be able to do anything about the heat ",2/5/19,2
"Staff was not welcoming upon our arrival she seemed annoyed by our visit. Heater did not work on our first night and the second night the heater made a clanking and whistle sound all night, finally issue was resolved for the third night. The bed sheets were ripped. The sheets looked grey not pure white, looked dirty even tho they smelled clean. The space is too small for a family we were three we could barely sit comfortable on the toilet in such a small space. The only two compliments are the house keeping and the shower. How’s keeping ladies were very nice, they offered to clean our room when we stepped out the second day even if we were a bit late in the morning, they cleaned very well. The shower water pressure was great. ",2/5/19,2
Row NYC hotel is well located but overall facility are just satisfactory. Elevator is always crowded & congested. Room heater is not good. Rooms are cramp. Lobby area are minimalist decor & seems like 2 star hotel standard,2/5/19,3
"Good, but the elevators were crowded all the time, we were at 17th floor, sometimes we waited for more then 10 minutes to go up. The unternet is pretty good, and the bar is cool too. A nice hotel to go with the famil ",2/5/19,4
"Three of us stayed in Row NYC on 8th Avenue, making it so convenient to Times Square. It has a small food court and bar with live music some nights. Staff are helpful and room was very clean but with two double beds it was very tight for space but it wouldn’t prevent me from staying there again. Usually hotel rooms are too warm but the temperature was just perfect during our stay. It was also great value for the triple room ",2/5/19,5
"Conveniently located by all theatres. Safe environment. Nice and clean. Breakfast was on if your want something on the run. Coffee was pricey, preferred Dunkin. Take advantage of the amenities they offer ",2/5/19,5
I accidentally booked a night at the row online and I tried for a full week to get through. All they do is give you the run around and nobody EVER answers to phone at the front desk. The phone rings and rings and they pick up the phone and hang it up without answering. I can’t even cancel my booking. I think the way they run their business is pitiful and I’m sick of their BS. I will never stay there. EVER. Their business model has set them up for failure,2/5/19,1
"Stayed here with my husband and our friends for my 50th , was a bit dubious about the place due to the reviews read on here , but don’t knw why we were worrying we were pleasantly surprised , junior upgraded us to a bigger room great view ,the room was adequate, we really only slept in there , it was cleaned every day , staff were very helpful , central location is fantastic , would definitely come here again and recommend to friends ",2/5/19,5
"I had an amazing stay at the Row Hotel in New York City... Junior the Brazilian Concierge was so incredibly on spot & so professional on getting us tips on tickets and everything else, that made me & family feel welcome and cozy, really dealing with one the best human beings we ever encountered! Junior made our trip one of the bests of our lives...Thank you Row Hotel ! Congratulations on having such a top employee.. ",2/4/19,5
"We stayed this past weekend at Row NYC and I couldn’t believe how great the location and rooms were compared with the price. After many visits to the city this might be the best price I’ve ever seen. We stayed in the penthouse with a connecting room. I was traveling with two teens and my dad, which means each needed some personal space. This set up worked great for us: living room kitchen/dining, two and a half bathrooms, and two bedrooms each with a king bed. The location was good. Just one block off Times Square. We walked to Times Square, Bryant Park, the Empire State Building, and Rockefeller Center from here. Also they have a food court with eight food places. I thought that was super convenient. Two things: I personally wouldn’t drink the water here and don’t park a car. Parking is $70-85 which is too much. ",2/4/19,5
Stayed for 5 days in January 19.The hotel is very clean and accommodating to all needs. Our room was a deluxe room. We had a good view on 22nd floor. The room was not the biggest hotel room I stayed in. But it was a great size for me and my 23 year old daughter. Rooms were cleaned daily. Large fiat screen tv on the wall. The only downside was there was not tea & coffee making facilities in the room. It was our first visit to New York. So I guess we thought it would be the same as the British hotels. But you can grab a coffee from 6.30am till late at the bar area. Also breakfast. Staff were fab in the food area. Very friendly and fun. Great security at the hotel at all times. Overall a great stay.,2/4/19,4
"Giving this 5 stars because of Douglas! He was absolutely fabulous. Positives about stay: Douglas and his 5 star service. I work in hospitality myself so love seeing service served with a smile. Location - absolutely IDEAL... right on times sqGeneral vibe - very cool and sort of 'W Hotel' esqe. Negatives:No exaggeration here, the world's WORST concierge lady I have ever ever come across. Unnatural blonde hair - SUPER unhelpful and came over to us and started the convo with ""Yeah, what do you want?"" simply AWFUL. She absolutely ruined the visit and my interaction with her was less than 5 minutes, which isn't great. Didn't know the answers to any of our questions and was just generally the most unfitting personality for a front facing role. Wish I got her name, but no name badge... Another con about her.Lifts. These were a BLOODY NIGHTMARE and no joke, would probably put me off staying here again!!!!!!! Only 4 in action and for a hotel with 27 floors, that is absolutely not ideal ",2/3/19,5
"Firstly, there was no Wi-Fi during my stay. Hard to fathom this can be a problem at such a large hotel in the middle of Manhattan.I was not able to stay for the full time for which I had originally booked. I got charged the full room rate for the night I did not arrive (which I am happy to pay), but then I also got charged a no show fee which was almost the cost of a full night stay as well. Please can someone explain to me how that makes sense?? Then when I checked out I received a hard copy bill with one amount of my bill outstanding, yet the online bill which they want to charge me is almost double. I have emailed and emailed, but no response to this problem. ",2/3/19,2
"Friendly and professional staff. Comfortable room. Needed more pure vegetarian options. WiFi in the roo. Was good, however WiFi elsewhere in the hotel (for example in the hotel lobbies) not satisfactory. Overall a good stay ",2/3/19,4
"Excellent location and a great price in a clean hotel with a comfortable bed. That said, room needed updating, no coffee/tea maker, no fridge, noisy plumbing and heating, cold shower on two days. Want to love this hotel, staff were great, it was a little funky in all the right ways, and with just a bit of work it could easily earn more stars. ",2/3/19,3
"Have stayed here thrice before, The last being in Jan 2019. Great location ! Front desk staff Junior was very nice to our group. We were there to celebrate a friends birthday. He upgraded us and gave us a fruit basket and water cartons. Will definitely return again!! GREAT JOB JUNIOR for always making us feel welcome  ",2/3/19,5
"My mum and I spent 3 nights here and loved it. The hotel is modern, clean and superbly located, though the rooms are so peaceful that you wouldn't think you are so close to Times Square. The staff are lovely and we got especially lucky with Junior who checked us in - he made us feel so welcome and special, something we didn't feel at other hotels on our trip.I loved that the hotel provides resuable water bottles and has water stations on some floors - money saving and eco-friendly. We didn't eat at the hotel but there are loads of places nearby and the subway is just around the corner. Would definitely return to this great hotel ",2/3/19,5
I was very satisfied withthe customer service and friendliness of thhe staff... also the room was prepared and cleaned... never had to wait long for house keeping in the mornings... loved the security aspect of the hotel..,2/3/19,5
"For the price, as close as it is to Times Square, its hard to beat. The rooms are small but unless you're planning on spending much time in your room its not important to have a ton of room. If you're looking for a central place to stay in the heart of the tourist area for low cost then this does well.My main complaint was that when I arrived in my room the bathroom wasn't really that clean. Found a few hairs on toilet seat and in the shower. I was exhausted from long travel so I just went to bed and they cleaned it the next day. After that no issue with cleanliness. Staff did a great job. Overall, good spot and hard to beat for the price point its in ",2/3/19,4
"The ROW Hotel is very central to all of the main attractions in NY. We had a problem the first night but were upgraded for the rest of the holiday. The rooms are clean, beds very comfy and the view was amazing. Staff are attentive and can’t do enough for you. We were room only as there is so much choice nearby for food. Room with a view ! Time square was just round the corner as was Broadway. Book the show before you arrive but be aware of scammer sites. Make sure you have your ESTA number so you can check in your flight. Other than that, have good walking shoes ! ",2/3/19,4
Make sure you understand the true price of the room. Charging a separate and large ($34.00) facilities fee is deceptive. The one good thing was the food court which had reasonably priced food of good quality,2/2/19,1
"Good hotel central for all sightseeing. Would really have liked a kettle and mug for early morning coffee. Otherwise, was great for what we wanted for the few days we were there. Bar area was friendly and had a good atmosphere. Didn’t use any meal facilities so can’t comment on food ",2/2/19,3
"Arrived with trepidation having read reviews... 1st room wasn't to my standards of clean but we were moved within minutes. Room was great, stay was excellent. If you're english bringteabags and a cup as they do give you a kettle if you ask! Thank yo ",2/2/19,4
The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. Hotel is right in the theater district so it’s eady to get to your shows on time. Clean room. Hot water without waiting. My room even had two windows and the view was great.,2/2/19,5
"The hotel with no doubts has a great location, thus service is definitely not a priority given their location. Upon arrival I had a bad check-in experience - it seemed the manager was having a discussion with the employees (he was very rude, addressing one of the agents with a 'yo girl'); the check-in agent was doing my check-in without even looking at me in the eyes, still complaining about the manager with her colleagues, and let's not even talk of being polite or smiley while checking in. The process was slow and inefficient. Rooms are small (not surprised, it's NYC) and they A/C was on and it was freezing outside; in addition it is very noisy ",2/1/19,2
Me and my mum stayed here for 4 night's. Great location and we received brilliant service at the reception. Especially from a female not sure of her name. Perfect for what we wanted to do. Which was see as much of New York as possible,2/1/19,4
"We stayed at row based on the videos we saw. The location was great. It was overpriced for what we got. It was very dirty. We paid extra for a high floor. We arrived to our room and there were cigarettes, and cigarette butts in the room. Both windows were open also. The tub had mold in the corners and there was a black stain on the white comforter. We complained and they moved our room down 10 floors but still charged us for the high floor. The elevators were ridiculously slow. We took the stairs most of the time ",2/1/19,2
"Our flight was delayed by 5 hours as you can imagine we were all extremely tired and anxious to get to our beds, There was a problem with our original booking to which the professional, calm, willing and friendly Shantelle was able to fix in a matter of minutes! Hotel is ideal for a family stay and would recommend it for all the right reasons ",2/1/19,5
"Lovely hotel, very central, great staff. Especially shantelle. She was nothing but exceptional. Would recommend highly. Food and drinks expensive but on the plus side you have Wi-Fi all over the hotel (Rooms included ",1/31/19,5
Enjoyed this location from the moment of arrival until the moment of departure! Everyone was friendly and helpful. The staff went above and beyond. Clean and comfortable. Close to the typical NYC experiences if that is what you’re looking for.,1/31/19,5
"Check in line moved a bit slowly, but that must have been due to other guests' needs. Our check in went swiftly and easily. Hotel is in great location - right in the middle of everything theater district/Times Square without being right in the middle of everything. I was surprised how quiet our room was. Great price for a fun place to stay. ",1/31/19,5
"To say I was shocked on arrival at the hotel would be an understatement. I booked a twin room. The receptionist made a big song and dance about saying he would upgrade the room as long as I have him good feedback (actually they don’t do twins anymore so two double beds was the cheapest and only room to suit my booking). The first room I was given the bath was dirty and mouldy (see photo), the carpet was filthy, it was dusty and the drawer was dangerous (see photo). I went downstairs to complain and they moved my room. Whilst repacking the door opened and 3 people entered who had been given my room. I had been 5 mins max and had not returned the key yet. If I hadn’t been in there my stuff could have been taken. I went to the new room, it was better still Very dusty (remained so the whole week despite me tipping the maid daily. See photo taken in day 4 of bedside table). The bath I ended up cleaning myself each day as I don’t think they bothered with the end near the taps and the plug wasn’t water tight so a bath was out of the question. The worse thing about the room is the noisy heating system. It squeals, clangs and bangs regularly when it fires up. You can not turn this off!!! So I had very little sleep. On day 4 also the electricity sockets blew next to the bed and the fridge was not cleaned the whole week either. It arrived dirty and remained dirty as I didn’t use it (see photo).You get an email from the manager when you arrive. I replied to this with my displeasure, I never received a reply or a follow up. Over $1000 for a week in January this hotel is overpriced and under delivers. ",1/31/19,2
"There are lots of hotels in the Times Square area, I would look eleswhere. Complained to the general manager in writing about the homeless guests; still waiting for a response! The hotel was renovated in 2009 and it is well overdue another upgrade ",1/31/19,2
"The rooms were relatively clean but very tiny...not much room to move around the beds and bathroom very small. Elevators were not all working so we had 20+ minutes waiting to each time. Convenient to Times Square, subway and 13 blocks to Penn Station ",1/31/19,3
"Just don't stay here. Service is shocking, the hotel is a noisy tourbus haven. Staff could not care less and helping you not in their job description. Nooone replies or follows up with issues - not even the manager when you contact him direct as per his welcome email!!?? Had a leather knee high boot thrown away by the cleaner and zero reply from staff. Charged crazy amounts to bring three online deliveries up to my room. More than double what it cost to get it across the country?! Will literally find anyway to make an extra buck out of you. I ended up leaving a day early which they agreed not to charge me for and then did charge me after I left?! Just don't do it to yourself. Better options close by without the hassle facto ",1/31/19,1
"Hotel experience was 10/10, but valet took almost 2 hours to bring the car after checkout. Completely unacceptable. We only had limited time to spend in NYC, short weekend trip. Set the whole day back. Demanded a refund but not sure if will receive. ",1/30/19,4
I loved the location of this hotel. The room was small and not as clean as I would prefer (bed sheets were not clean) but overall still worth the cost. The elevator was a little hard to navigate but it did get the job done.,1/30/19,4
"A mixed bag. We had one of the larger rooms with a city view. The good bits, bed and pillows comfy. Lifts fast and have to show pass at night. Has a travelodge / budget feel about it. Heater in room very efficient great location for theatre district and subway at 42nd street. Water machine on level not working, had to ask for shampoo twice. Room quite clean but found a pair of socks in drawer. Room key needed reprogramming a couple of times but probably our fault as stored it close to mobile phone. District m expensive. Would we stay again, probably not rather pay more ",1/30/19,3
"I liked the location - very centric and close to everything I needed. The service what excellent except during the check in where i was advised to await a call to be advised that the room was vacant and clean - the call never came> from there one forward all was fantastic. food, service ambianc ",1/30/19,5
To arrive at a hotel after a 7 and half hour flight from Ireland to be told they have no rooms and are transferring to another hotel. Eventually having 4 children in our party they gave us rooms. Having 2 rooms booked they could offer us one room and the other to be ready later in the evening. The one room we did get the safe wasnt working and we had to await an engineer to have a look. With a party of 2 adults and 4 children we wanted to be able to leave passports and cash in the safe for our own safety walking around,1/30/19,3
The hotel is in the theater district and within walking distance of many theaters and restaurants. Bed and pillows was very comfortable. Nice continental breakfast. Only complaint was the bathtub had some mold on the edges,1/30/19,4
This is the fifth time I have stayed at The Row NYC. Rooms are always clean and the staff is very friendly. Breakfast downstairs is way above average and having city kitchen attached to the hotel is also a great option for lunch and dinner. This hotel is so conveniently located to time is it a square and has a subway stop right across the street. I’ve always considered this hotel to be a great value as well. If you ask for the higher floors it is a lot quieter and with better views. The elevators are super fast which is great for moving people quickly when many people are trying to return to the hotel in the evening. I like the security of having to show your room key in the evening to get onto the elevators. I asked for late check out and they gave me an hour later!,1/30/19,5
I stayed at the Row for the NRF convention and it happened to be a nice and comfortable hotel very well located at a couple of blocks from Times Squares.Don't expect big rooms in NYC at a good price but at least mine was comfortable and affordable. Something worth to mention was the extremely poor water pressure in the shower,1/30/19,3
"First time in many visits the Front desk was rude and gave us the wrong room. When we went back and told the guy, he acted like we were the ones that went to the wrong room instead of owning his error. They promised us a Macy's gift card and never gave it to us. Last visit for us. ",1/30/19,3
The parking service which they was offering you was terrible. The people at the front desk was telling me that it need 15-20min to get my car back. I was waiting for 1h20min and missed my flight in addition of their delay. They still charged me 70USD and told me that's not their problem. That's for me unacceptable why would anybody pay for a service like this.,1/30/19,1
"We paid about $400 for 3 nights. This seemed like a good deal compared to other hotels in the area, however we were gravely disappointed upon arrival. Dirty rooms, dirty floors, very uncomfortable. I wouldn’t stay here again and wouldn’t recommend it. Chance a different cheap hotel ",1/30/19,2
Staff unhelpful when trying to resolve issues with room. Cockroach lying dead in bathroom on arrival. Superior rooms are actually rooms for disabled. Location very good. Overall not a pleasent stay and would not stay here agai,1/30/19,1
"Located steps from Times Square and the subway, one of the best values in the city. Rooms are small but they all are small in NYC. Clean and well kept though. Hotel is one of the best values in NYC. Nothing fancy but the hotel has a trendy feel. ",1/29/19,4
"My stay at Row NYC over the weekend was very disappointing. The room was not at all like it was pictured online. Not only was it very small and claustrophobic, but it was dirty and did not function well. When we turned on the blow dryer (provided in the room) it blew a fuse and we were in complete darkness. We had to then wait for someone to come fix it and as a result we were late for our dinner reservation with clients. On top of that there was mold in the bath room, the room was dirty, and not well maintained. We were told when checking in that we were getting a room with one of the best views... that was sadly disappointing, as there was no view at all. The hallways were filled with marijauna smoke, most people were just smoking in the open.... I thought it was a non-smoking floor, I have asthma and could barely breathe. I am very unhappy with my stay and can't believe I actually paid to stay there. The room was not as it was described online and was very unsanitary, I felt disgusted and can't believe this is the condition they rent rooms in. I also have worked at a hotel and never saw anything like this in my life. The sad part is that most of these items could be avoided. The mold in the shower, the cleanliness, at least some regulation of the smoking... these all are very easy fixes. It is not fair to guests, especially with children who think that this is an OK, safe, and clean place to stay. IT IS NOT. ",1/29/19,1
"Staff are so ever friendly and very accomodating. Room is always kept cleana and in order. Bed is comfortable. The area itself is so accessable ,( subway and city). There are a lot of restaurants around. Excellent choice ",1/29/19,5
"Several issues. Room had last guests hair EVERYWHERE! On the bed, on the desk, on the shower curtain. Just gross! Bed was ridiculously hard and uncomfortable. Booked room on their site and prepaid. Was surprised with fees DOUBLE the rate I agreed to upon checkout. Very deceiving. After paying double the hotel was definitely not worth the price. Very disappointed with this property and will never stay there again. ",1/29/19,2
This is a very well run property with excellent staff. All furnishings and fixtures are new and clean. The food outlets in the building are great and the location is excellent for the value. I have stayed at the property 4 times and have been pleased each time,1/29/19,5
"I had a great stay at Row NYC. Great location plus nice employees. First I was going to stay for 10 days, then I decided do extend for 15 days. Marcelo from the reception is one of a kind. The infrastructure is also very nice ",1/29/19,5
"This hotel is very central, we were room only, although you can buy breakfast in the hotel. However there is no shortage of places to eat nearby. The room was small, but clean, some of the décor tired, there is a well stocked and quit lively bar. This is a budget hotel. Hotels in New York tend to be more expensive than the UK, this hotel is alright for a quick visit. No frills ",1/29/19,3
"Overpriced, super small, valet is a rip-off. Was told it would be $70. Turned out to be $85 PER day. Location is good! Will never stay here again. Came here for major gymnastics event. We won't make this mistake again ",1/28/19,2
"* Booked a twin but was given a double.* We asked for a fridge but was refused.* The room was tiny, the space between the end of bed and the wall was about 50cm.* The lady who served as was not pleasant, got the feeling that she really didn't want to be there.* We were charged $34/night on top of the room rental, they labelled it as ""Facilities Fee"", why not add this to the room price in the first place. Obviously, they wouldn't as it would show the room as more expensive so customers will not book. In other words its way to scam people. Summery: There are so many other hotels in NYC that would provide much better value and experience for the money you give to ROW NYC Hotel. Therefore, I will not recommend you booking this hotel ",1/28/19,1
Overall a good bargain and experience at Row NYC. Great location. Great staff. Great “ conceptual” elevator system WHEN IT WORKED. Maybe just dumb luck when it came to this but they were down twice in my 3 day stay. Nice hotel for being so old. I would stay again.,1/28/19,4
"the Hotel is great , got to meet Junior and Marcelo at front Desk , Excellent service!!! I will definitely recommendRooms were cleaned everyday , friendly housekeeping staff.in lobby there are some restaurants that give 10 percent discount ",1/28/19,5
"Just arrived today. Charged a ridiculous admin fee of 250 dollars above what we’d already paid for the hotel. Fuming at that, but continued. Got to the room, you couldn’t swing a cat in it. Tiny, dirty, about 4 hangers in “wardrobe area” - and this is meant to be a double room. I’m 6”7 and can’t even fit in the bed. The bathroom is basically a cubicle. We’ve got 5 nights of this left. Comes to something when we’re counting down the days on day one to go back to England! ",1/27/19,1
"The staff, such as Robert, front desk, exceptional, authentic person with a wonderful work ethic. Service and rooms are excellent. I use the deluxe city view ADA rooms most of the time, but all of the rooms are wonderful. ",1/27/19,5
"A literal 3 ring circus. Absolutely filthy, unkept, & way over- priced for the quality of the rooms. Peeling, chipped, moldy paint & fixtures. Bathroom was smaller than you would find in a travel trailer. Mold on shower curtain, rust on fixtures. When we used the hair dryer, the power went out! No fridge, no room service, no frills of any sort. They even used old Target shopping bags as trash can liners! Down in what they call the cocktail lounge, you need your room key to access the ladies room. Needless to say, we left & checked into a new hotel the next morning ",1/27/19,1
"Excellent, I work two theaters down 45th street.... When working long hours, the staff is receptive, and rooms clean and comfortable and much better than commuting home. I've always been grateful and satisfie ",1/27/19,5
"Every time I am in New York, the Row NYC is always my choice. Great location, rooms and most importantly great staff. I want to mention Junior in particular for his amazing service, problem solving skills and charisma, he is extremely helpful and always wants to make sure we get the best treatment. Definitely the reason why we always come back to the same hotel for more than 3 years in a row (no pun intended) ",1/26/19,5
"Too many outsiders coming in and out the hotel freely - no security. Room - noisy with mechanical problems,shower nit functioning properly,,elevators unsafe, the whole hotel gives me horrible u safe feeling during my expensive stay for 5 days a bill of £800 ! Not worth the value at all ",1/26/19,2
"Nothing special at all. Staff spoke in different languages when booking us in which i find ignorant.I had been billed for a superior room and it was anything but superior. Dirty room,draft coming from window,beds terrible,paper thin walls could hear everything from next room and staff were not helpful at all. Also when walking from my room to the elevators the smell of marijuana coming from the room which the door was open. I understand that staff can not do anything about this initially but a member of staff walked past and done nothing about it. Also on one night there was multiple police officers in the lobby because of an incident that evening.I would not recommend this hotel at all. I found it extremely difficult to enjoy my first time in new york i had been traveling for 10 hours and to arrive to this was so so bad i was so disappointed. Another thing is i had to pay 34 dollars a night for hotel tax i dont know if this a normal thing but once i had booked it i thought that was it all paid for.The only thing this hotel has going for it is its location ",1/25/19,1
we Stayed at the Row for 7 days last week. We were on the 24th floor in a double room at the front well all ican say is WOW. warm spotless and amazing staff. The hotel is in a brilliant location for Times Square and everything you could need including the tube station up the street. Thank you so much to the amazing Douglas on reception what a guy. Also to all the other brilliant staff. The food in the hotel is lovely and also the magnificent band. You all made our holiday AMAZING. Thank you All,1/25/19,5
"Much Like the hotel, very well located. the rooms and service very well, al the restaurant excellent. They should improve the internet service. very good room, very attentive staff service. Excellent Service Securit ",1/25/19,4
"this hotel is the bare minimal. it offers close to nothing for the same price of other nearby hotels that offer a lot more. i would only recommend this hotel if it's last minute booking and you just need a place to lay your head or you're a minimalist and just need a bed to satisfy your stay. they do not offer room service, dinning options after 11pm, no blow dryers in the room, rooms are extremely small and outdated. Bathroom was falling a part. ",1/25/19,2
"We first visited Row Nyc March 2017 and had an amazing time. Second time we decided to come back and again it was a wonderful stay. We arrived early and Parizada at the reception kindly gave us an early check in which enabled us to head towards Times Square immediately. The only thing Id like to advise the future guests is about the Woodbury common premium outlet experience which is fully advertised outside the hotel. The tickets cost $40 per person and you have the rudest staff members selling you the tickets outside. However, looking at tripadvisor i found The Mills at Jersey Garden as another outlet option owned by the same people. The tickets cost $14 per person for a round trip from the Port Authority which is a 2minute walk from the hotel and you dont even have a set time to return. You do not need to rush at all. And the shops are the same as the Woodbury common outlet. Overall great experience for a city break and shopping! Cant wait till were back with our little son in the future: ",1/25/19,5
"Location is great for Times Square and centrally located, room was not fit for a family and the corridors dark and dingy. The reception was OK, lots of issues with electronic key cards, but we did not experience one ",1/25/19,3
"Perfect location for broadway, hop on hop off bus tours & Times Square with so many locations in walking distance. When checking in Douglas was so kind and welcoming considering how rude people have been in New York we were so pleased by this. Love the food options in the hotel, the ramen is delicious. Rooms were smaller then we thought but we only sleep there so doesn’t matter at all. Couldn’t of chosen a better hotel and the system of elevators works well. Good price and is worth the stay ",1/24/19,4
"I visit the city about four times a year, always use the Row. The price is usually right, not far from where the bus drops off, room is always ready and tidy, all-around always a great stay, looking forward to my next visit! ",1/24/19,5
"great location to start each day from, close to Times Square, Broadway and lots of bars & Restaurants. clean and tidy with friendly staff. the double bed was quite small this time - when we have stayed here previously it was as a family and had 2 large beds ",1/24/19,4
"Check in nice and simple, very spacious reception area, the corridors are very dark, the room was quite small compared to looking at the pictures on the internet, the bed also small but comfortable, overall the room was clean although the bathroom could have had a bit more elbow grease put into it. Iron and ironing boards plus hair dryer supplied, free internet but no tea making facilities. There is an area above the bar that has several different places to eat so a wide choice to suit most people, prices were quite reasonable but then you have to pay tax on top.We also didn't realise that you are charged a services charge plus tax and some other addition so we had a bill of $130 taken from our card when we left. Hotel location however is amazing, there are a number of bars and restaurants on the street in front and if you walk either left or right out of the hotel and back 1 street you are literally on Times Square. City site seeing tour guides are outside the hotel, we got a 3 day pass for the price of a 24 hour one, so for 56$ it was a bargain and the blue tour stop is literally feet from the hote ",1/24/19,3
"The guest services personnel are all wonderful. Nolly, who checked us in, is at the top! Our room was clean, spacious, and with a wonderful view. The nice breakfast was included in our package ~ definitely worth it! This location is great for its close proximiity to Broadway shows and good restaurants. The subway is next door for further away attractions. We will stay here again ",1/23/19,5
"Rooms are nice and overall clean, but equipment is worn out and plumbing smells permeate now and then through the hallways. The bathroom is spotless, but the bureaus and desk didn't seem so.The facility fee is too high. Having internet is great, as is the gym, but they're not extraordinary services to qualify a price that hikes up your overall value. (Plus, the gym is too small and has a short ceiling ",1/23/19,3
Like already mentioned I am very dissapointed that items have been removed from a bag I forgot on the 15th of January at the bar. The staff put it away safely that evening and did see 3 items in the bag. The next morning 2 items were missing from the bag although the bag was behind the bar and out of sight from any guest.,1/23/19,4
"Fantastic theater district location. Room rate was excellent. Staff is friendly and hard working. Facility is old, but functional and clean. The continental breakfast included in our room rate was wonderful and the District M staff (where breakfast was held ) is great ",1/23/19,3
This was our 2nd time staying at the ROW it is a great hotel and perfectly situated just of times square on 8th AvenueThe staff are very polite and welcoming especially christina s on front desk.The hotel rooms are spacious and cleaned every day by the maids who were excellent,1/23/19,5
"The room was very comfortable The staff very helpful and polite I love the convenient location. I do wish there was a free breakfast, the use of computers is great and a primo. The hotel is close to the theaters we will stay again ",1/22/19,5
This is my 10 tenth time staying at Row. I always feel welcome and very safe during my stay. I love everything about the hotel. The price is great as well as the location. I plan to visit at least once a year and Row will always be my NYC vacation home.,1/22/19,5
"Do not , repeat , do not stay here. They lie about the rate and package deals , they do not rectify. Rooms are gross.. carpet has stains all over , bathroom has mold on ceiling , hairs in tub...rooms are the size of a shoe box, staff are all rude. The elevators are absurd , they are dangerously small, to fit all the people trying to get it, if you miss and elevator, you will he waiting 10-15 for the next one to get you. ",1/22/19,2
"Had an awesome stay, been conning here for 5 years, mom and daughter for her bday wkend...they upgraded is to an amazing suite! Absolutely gorgeous suite, clean, modem, amazing views!! Convenient perfect location! ",1/22/19,5
Housekeeping did not make our room one evening and the beds were of poor quality. Rooms are extremely compact. During our stay we noticed people who were not hotel guests roaming around and this made us feel rather uncomfortable.,1/22/19,2
The location of the hotel is excellent.The room was very clean and the staff are also very kind. I would recommend this hotel who plan to visit New York City as the hotel rooms are priced at very reasonable rate too,1/22/19,5
"A Gorgeous lobby invites you in. Amenities: There is a little shop inside for sweets/snacks/drinks and other travel items. There are PC's you can use to print off trip tickets free of charge. There is a place you can store your luggage if you need too guarded by a doorman. Theres a water fountain too fill up the free water bottle the hotel gives you. Staff: Were very helpful and friendly. Food: There is a restaurant/cafe on site but we did not use it. Rooms: Were small by modern, we were out all day and most of the night so it worked for us. The rooms were warm and you could control the temperature. However the heater was very loud and disturbed our sleep. We had a nice big window with a view of the street below so it was very loud at night with car horns and traffic (but it is the city that never sleeps so you can put up with it). The walls and doors were very thin so we could hear alot of noise in the night from the elevator lobby and other rooms. Location: was perfect close to times square (5-10 min walk) and a supermarket for snacks/food opposite. surrounded by restaurants ",1/22/19,4
Was worried about staying here after reading some reviews on trip advisor. However i needed not worry. Staff at check in were v friendly. Rooms were basic but cleaned everyday. This place is in a fantastic location in new york. We had a great time here and would defo come back. Also i see a lot of people complaining about the lifts. These are only complicated if your an idiot. Kind regardsJames higgin,1/22/19,4

"Just got back from another great week in NYC, I have stayed in the Row everything I have been. The staff were always great, any questions I had they answered. Hotel rooms are small but that didn't bother me because I only used the toon to sleep in. The rooms are very clean and well maintained. There's live entertainment every night in the bar which was great to chill and gave a few drinks after a long day exploring. Hotel is very close to times square and Broadway (5 minute walk) I'm already looking again for my next trip and I will be staying here again. Well recommended. ",1/21/19,5
"I stayed here for a week. The front desk was not friendly, the doorman was helpful, breakfast was not worth paying for, and city kitchen didn't have enough options. I only liked the location of this hotel. I could walk everywhere. I wish the room and closet were large enough to accommodate a week long business trip ",1/21/19,3
"This hotel is in a good location. The people working there were also quite nice. My room, while small,. was clean and quiet. The bar is nice and the location next to the city kitchen was a plus. What I did not like was the fact that I had to pay a very large facility fee-far beyond the cost of internet and fees charged by other hotels. This seems to me to exploitative of the guests and makes the room prices shown on web sites somewhat deceptive Also, while I was there the computer system broke down and many guest had to wait extended periods of time for their roo ",1/21/19,2
Always friendly and professional staff. Very comfortable atmosphere. Added feature is the in- house Kitchen food court. Lobby bar great for meeting friends. Staff ready to meet all needs such as guides to tourist atractions and shopping,1/21/19,5
"A great hotel that I will recommend to all of my friends. Best place to stay in New York. The center of everything. Great beds excellent service, beautiful view. Would love to bring my grand children to stay here. Very caring staff. Best service ever. ",1/20/19,5
"good location but cleanliness of the hotel was not what i was expecting and very basic, would have liked more from the room. no breakFAST OR room service options and didn't provide water bottle or mini bar in the room. ",1/20/19,2
"I enjoyed the service, cleanliness of the rooms and security and the perfect location to walk to food, time square, movies and bowling. The lobby was decorated beautifully for Christmas and I loved the Sugar Factory being onsite. I love it ",1/20/19,5
"Took advantage of their winter rate.Had a city view, upgraded room. Free breakfast and friendly staff. Love their elevators that are dedicated to your floor and overall it was a great stay, as usual ",1/20/19,5
"Where to begin? The first room we were put in was absolutely the worst room I have ever stayed in bar none. (Including hostels) It was tiny, the bed was tiny, the room was tiny and the bathroom was like a closet. The room was also next to the elevators and the sound was constant. All night!!!! (We forgot to take pics of this room as we were so disappointed we just wanted to get out of there)Thankfully we managed to upgrade to a “suite” for the remaining 4 nights or we would have left the hotel. It was that bad! The suite was better space wise but still our stay wasn’t great. The bathroom had peeling ceiling, mould and dirty tiles. The living room sofa was grotty, the air conditioning cover was off the unit and the surround for the tv was falling apart.Day 1 in the suite we had to phone for a hairdryer and to be fair they did send one up fairly quickly.Day 4 of our stay they completely forgot to clean our room. After a long day out we then had to vacate the room for a bit whilst they hurriedly gave the room a very light clean. Also day 4, we had been shopping and spent quite a bit at Micheal Kors so the shop messengered our purchases to the hotel so we wouldn’t have to carry the bags. When we got back to the hotel at about 9pm. They wanted to charge us $11 for accepting the bag. When we queried it the receptionist snootily informed us that they were not a FedEx facility and they accepted “thousands of parcels a day” Really??? Thousands???? We had to pay the $11 before being directed to pick up our shopping at the gift store. Which I can tell you does not have the room for “thousands of parcels” a day.The attitude of this receptionist made having to pay $11 feel way worse than it would have done! Also, before our stay I phoned the hotel as I wanted to ask a question about something and I was passed from dept to dept. Finally leaving a message for them. They are still to return that call. Shocking rooms, not clean and mostly terribly rude staff! Central location was pretty much the only plus about our visit to this hotel. (Only one decent staff member that we met and he was called Rob and he sorted the upgrade out on the first night ",1/20/19,1
"Myself and my boyfriend checked into this hotel for 9 nights, when we first arrived we thought it was lovely (the bar, computers, the lounge etc) We then went to check in and the lady who took care of our reservation was lovely, she randomly offered us a complimentary upgrade, we were delighted! When we went to our room we were shocked, if this was the upgrade I wouldn’t like to see a standard room, I think reception just says it to make it sound better but it definitely wasn’t and upgrade! We knew the rooms were going to be small as we were informed by friends that had stayed previously but we weren’t expecting the rooms to be so run down and dirty! -All around the carpet was so dirty and looked like it had never been hoovered! -Along the headboard of our bed was so dusty with a few black hairs (my hair is blonde and I had only arrived)! -Down the side and back of bed was so dirty! -The desk had coffee/coke stains and also had dust (out of curiosity I tried to wipe a piece off to see if it came off and it wiped off straight away) -The desk also had cracks all over it.-On the left hand side of the tv there were 4 marks (possible a hand print) it seemed to be make up or fake tan on the white gloss (I also tried to wipe it off and it came off instantly) -The vent in the bathroom was all rusted! -Along the panel in the bathroom was full of dirt and dust, looked like it had never been cleaned. -There was also a piece in the bath that was hanging when we went in.It seems to me that housekeeping just changes bed and towels for new guests because if not I’m sure they would have even wiped the desk! Very disappointing for the money I had spent on this hotel visit! Unfortunately photos do no justice. ",1/19/19,3
"We stayed here last weekend when we went to see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child because the hotel is only a block away from the theater. Pros: great location, good price, yummy City Hall good kitchen, efficient elevator system. Cons: rooms are run down and not clean. We reserved a king bed on a high floor and when we checked in the room reeked of smoke, the blinds were broken, and the tub was dirty. We opened the windows to air the room out and called the front desk. They said housekeeping while clean the room while we were out. When we came back a few hours later the room was exactly the same only now it was late and we were tired. I called again and they moved us to a different room, in the same corner but a few floors lower. The manager said we were lucky because this was a better room than what we had before. The room was the same size as the old room but with a smaller bed and was just as tired and dirty. He acted like he was doing be a favor and I didn't appreciate that. He did waive a fee for us and said we could move to a king bed he following night. I would not stay here again. ",1/19/19,2
"The service was terrible, i never come back. I paid the upgrade, the room is the same and the cleaning of the room was horrible. Nobody answer the phone after 6:00 pm. The security Guys were very rude ",1/18/19,1
"This is my fourth or fifth stay at Row NYC. As always, my latest stay was uneventful (that's GOOD!) and very comfortable. The room was clean and comfortable. The only complaint I have is the water pressure, especially the hot water pressure. It is very weak. This is not a new issue. It seems to be a regular situation. To me this is a minor problem but for some it might be more important ",1/18/19,5
"Nice central hotel, I paid bill on check out and teller said all was in order with the bill. But when I arrived home to Ireland another charge was taken from my credit card without permission. Pay in cash is my tip for everyoneMartin ",1/18/19,2
"Just checking out now after a 4 night stay and while it is a fantastic location the rooms are very poorly maintained. Peeling paint above the shower, ripped towels that do not look well laundered. The style of the room is good and modern but just grubby and absolutely no upkeep done on them. Came back to around 80 waiting to go up to their rooms in the lifts but out of the 8 lefts only 3 working and no week organised at all. It seems to be a head down and ignore situation. Would chose to stay here again. Much better choices and for the same money ",1/18/19,2
"The Hotel Associate, Shantelle, treated me like I was the only one in the hotel. She gave me such kind and gracious assistance as she found the very best room for me. She also invited me to come down and listen to the band and gave me a complimentary drink voucher. When I entered the room, I cried with joy. It was so beautiful and clean. The view was breathtaking. The linens were white and the shower had ample towels. The shower was welcoming. I had to stay at the hotel because I live in NJ, and I had to make sure that the forecast of snow did not stop me from getting to work on Friday. But after last night experience, I am going to occasionally stay at the Row NYC Hotel because I felt GRAND! Thank you Management ",1/18/19,5
"I travel to NYC 2-3 times a year and I have stayed at this hotel 4 times. The first time I stayed at this hotel it was still the Milford Plaza in the process of converting in The Row hotel, although the hotel was under construction and there were a lot of disruptions the staff were incredibly helpful and eager to make sure my stay was great, I'm glad those values have not changed.I come to NYC to mostly see Broadway shows, this hotel in in the perfect location if you're planning to see a show or you just like being incredible close to the action but not right in the middle of it. The room I most recently stayed in was incredible, with incredible view of the city. A few friends who live in the city were blown away by the views from the room.I used to package service mutliple times and enjoyed arriving to my room to see my packages from Amazon were waiting for me. During a previous stay I encountered a problem and after letting Maurizio (The GM) know he and his team went above and beyond to make it right. This hotel is one of the best in the area with a team who will go above and beyond to make your stay fantastic. I recommend this hotel to everyone who asks where to stay in the city, I am in the process of planning a trip to nyc for this February and I will being staying at The Row.- Kaine Demerchan ",1/18/19,5
Overall enjoyed our stay here the rooms are clean and today not very big but all you need for getting out in the city and is very central to all local attractions.I didn’t find the receptionist very friendly and they don’t rush to help you very much but whatever.I didn’t eat in used this hotel just for somewhere to stay. Too expensive for the price for sure and the hallways are very Dark and remind of American horror story the hotel series I found that quite funny tho but overall if too got money to spend stay here it’s ok,1/17/19,3
This hotel looks cool from the photos and the price was great. But the room I got was next to an elevator and too loud for sleep. They lost a package supposed to come to my room and the room was not cleaned properly during my stay. Front desk staff was apathetic and cold.,1/17/19,2
"so close to everything, Hell's Kitchen, Theater District, Times Square. Easy walking distance to Rockefeller and Central Park. Hotel facilities are excellent, as well as service. Very close to subway, easy access to JFK ",1/17/19,5
"A very basic hotel, the rooms are very small which I can understand being in NYC. The whole place is very dark and dingy and the cleanliness of the rooms needs to be bought to the attention of the management. Stains up the curtains, shower walls had watermarks and thick dust on mirror tops etc. Seems the housekeeping is a quick flick job! The reception staff need some work on customer service and it says something when your doormen are more sociable, maybe management need to swap them round. We didn't eat there as it was so expensive. I am more than happy to stay in small, basic hotels as long as they are clean but the icing on the cake for me was having to pay a resort tax for water which was not needed alongside call charges. ",1/17/19,2
"If you're after a clean, basic hotel in an amazing location then this is the hotel for you. After reading some very mixed reviews on here , myself and my 2 friends were a little concerned but we had no need to worry.Yes the reception staff could do with being a little more welcoming but when I explained that 2 of us were celebrating turning 40 this month, we were instantly offered an upgrade to a deluxe city view room and a complimentary drink each from the hotel bar so I can't complain.The rooms are compact but basically clean. Similar standard to a travel lodge. The beds were very comfy and were changed every day along with the towels.The only bad thing I could say about room was how noisy the heating/air con system was and along with the noise of the city we quickly realised it is the city that never sleeps.The location of this hotel is definately its main selling point. Just off time square, near the theatre district and within walking distance of a lot of the main attractions you can't loseAll in all we had a very good stay here and would definitely consider staying here agai ",1/17/19,4
"On entering our room we noticed how small it was for 4 people only one person was able to move around at a time ! hand prints and marks all over the mirror which is blocked every time some one wants to use the bathroom as it slides over the mirror , secondly we noticed left over food / crisps / crumbs down the side of the bed , how this was missed is unbelievable as the bed was made every day as well as for us arriving , months of dust under the mattress and down the side of the bed , Chinese currency under the bed as well as bits of paper and a rolled up carrier bag . I rang reception on 3 occasions no one answered , so I emailed them a further 3 times and no reply so on check out when they expected to receive £157 for resort fees ( which they advertise there free WiFi on sites like booking ,com ) but include it with in the resort fees ! I explained face to face about the filith in the room she immediately said we did not have to pay the resort fees which I wasn’t expecting with out a fight . But the fact they still have not responded to my emails or any other further communication is not on , I would advise to lift your mattresses up and check down the back of the beds as well as the mattress it’s self your paying good hard earned money to stop there and expected nothing but high standards I will include a few pics of what we where actually lying on ! Apart from that it’s in a great location but standards seriously let them down , maybe if some one had the professionalism to reply back to me maybe I would not be posting here for every one to see  ",1/17/19,2
Do not be surprised if your room is filled with obnoxious cooking odors from next door! This NYC Hotel seems geared toward non-business guests. Was required to pack up and move to another floor and no refund was offered for this problem,1/17/19,2
The lighting in the hallways and elevator makes the place creepy and dirty looking. The front desk staff were blunt and uninviting... never again! This place used to be our go to everytime we were in NYC. The new owners should have left it the way it wa,1/17/19,1
"Employees here are rude and mean. They don’t know how to apologize and make things right. Had terrible experience overall. Had a pipe noise every single hour inside our room. I called first thing in the morning and told I need to come down to talk to a manager. After talking to a manager, I was told to check out and come back at 4pm for another room instead of prioritizing it and giving me an available room right away. Upon checking back in after 4pm, i was assigned to another room and gave me smaller room instead than the first one. No apologies heard from any of the employees. This hotel can be nice if they can only hire good employee with right manners and attitude. The management should really do triple screen their candidates or employees before hiring. They only care about money especially tips as they are very vocal about it. ",1/16/19,1
"Had a great stay in new york, it was the perfect time to travel. Not too crowded and very friendly staff. We would definitely recommend the Row for our next visit. We've already have recommended it to our friends ",1/16/19,5
"Have to say it is the second time I have been to this hotel & always have found it to be great, my son & I were checked in by Zac, who was extremely helpful, great guy who gave us a perfect start to a wonderful holiday. Thanks Zac & Dougie ",1/16/19,3
"Very rude staff, very poor service. Room walls are thinner than paper, needs a full revamp. Take $150 off your card for spending in the hotel but if you dont spend it you wont get it back. Radiator making loud noise. Informed staff but wasnt resolved. People banging on our door at 12am and other holiday goers saying the same people trying to get in their room. Very rude staff ",1/16/19,1
"Location was convenient for the show, but couldn't check in at 2:30 for a 4:00 show. Had to return after the show and stand in line again. Room keys were not with luggage storage. In the morning, the line for the three elevators was so long, we walked down from the 21st floor. Be prepared for a very small bathroom, but the view was very nice ",1/16/19,3
"Me and my mother stayed at the Row and the staff there made out stay there very nice. The security was very friendly and polite and would definitely go there again in the future. There was a man who communicated to us and kept us company while we waited for our taxi and I appreciate what he did, which proves that they go above and beyond to provide good customer service ",1/15/19,5
Row hotel is in a wonderful place but the room is little and dirty. loudest full of people rude .the waitress absolutely rude when I asked her the clean sheet she don’t respond me at the last change the sheets but without pleasure....the only wonderful thing is the place,1/15/19,3
"I was very apprehensive because of the bad reviews. We were on the 12th floor. The room was had plenty of outlets for our phones. The bed was comfortable and I inspected the bedding, crisp and clean. The quarters were snug on one side of the bed but nothing to gripe about, you're in the City. The fees were $169 for 2 nights, taxes, wifi and whatever but again you are in the City! The employees were very pleasant. No we didnt have a view but we chose a standard room, the view is outside where we intended to be!! A little noise Saturday night but it was the neighboring door, they are metal and make a noise when pulling them shut. Water/ice was just down the hall we filled our complimentary water pouches for our walks. We were there to take in the City not hang out in a hotel room and watch TV all day! With all that said we were part of the Wyndham resort/ vacation group there for a promotional presentation, but I don't feel we were given any special treatment. As a matter of fact the room would have been less through Trip Advisor then the promo was... I will be returning I loved our stay. This Hotel is perfectly located, we easily walked everywhere!!!! General area covered in one day and a half... from the UN to the Intrepid and everything in between ",1/15/19,5
"Contemporary hotel near theaters - very conveniently . Rooms are clean, connectivity to wifi was easy, staff was helpful and friendly. The bar was comfortable with good appetizers. We will definitely stay here again ",1/15/19,5
"Hotel is very good, good location, close to subways and other stations. Walk distance from Times Square and other attractions , people work in the hotel are very kind as well. Only sad thing is the tax you pay if you receive any package even if it is not staying in the storage for one day ",1/15/19,5
"My 2 friends and I travelled to NY to celebrate our 40th birthdays. We got a great deal to stay at this hotel for 4 nights. However, started to doubt our decision after reading many poor reviews on here. When we arrived we were pleasantly pleased as we were dreading what we’d find. We stayed in room 1414. Yes the room was small and basic but it was adequate for the very little time we spent in there.We would compare the room to a UK Travelodge standard. It was clean and the beds were comfy. Towels and bedding were cleaned everyday and never dirty.We were upgraded to a room with a view and given complimentary drinks vouchers for our birthdays. There’s no issue with lifts. They may be confusing to use 1st time but we never waited for a lift considering the hotel capacity.The hotel is located a 2 minute walk from Times Square so the location was perfect. We did not smell weed in the corridors or from other rooms. But did smell it every where around New York (not surprising when you see how many weed vans come out at night).We had no issues with WiFi access. Although we couldn’t use our phone for calls even though they were meant to be included in our facility fee.The first few floors of this hotel appear to be used by some sort of housing association. However, we had no issue with this - there was never any sense of threat or trouble. Check out is at 12pm. However the hotel kindly allowed us to keep our room until 2pm. We’re planning on returning to NYC and would consider staying here again.So if you are booked to stay here and feeling nervous after reading the reviews on here- then please don’t be! ",1/15/19,4
"We travelled to NY for my daughters 16th Birthday. Booked 4 nights at the Row NYC based on its ‘ instagram Looks. The reception, bar area and food kitchen is impressive and chic if a little manic. The food at the fish place in the city kitchen was the best I’ve ever tasted. However... that’s where the good ends.We booked a quad room... luxury City view room. 2 double beds in what I imagine is a standard double room. The 2nd bed is just squashed in. I asked a maid to look in a STANDARD double room... it was the same as ours minus the extra double bed.We booked a city view luxury room. Nothing great about the view at all. We faced a car park and the main road outside the hotel. Literally no room to walk around the beds, nowhere for cases. There were 4 of us.. 2 adults and 2 16 year olds. 4 cases. I’m sure you can imagine. No where to hang coats etc. No wardrobe.. a little gap in the wall covered by. Curtain with 3 hangers in. Really not good enough. We’ve stayed in many city’s, this is the smallest, below standard room based on the amenities we’ve ever seen1. No wardrobe space. Hole in the wall with 3 hangers2. No tea and coffee or mini bar in the room3. No ironing board4. Very dusty and no attention to detail, lots of paint chips and scuffs on the walls. Just grubby needs some tlc5. 2nd bed rammed in to a standard double room6. The maid told me there is no difference between standard and luxury double rooms. Obviously just the extra cost charged to customers. The rooms are dirty. Grubby and not of a 4 star standard at all. Maybe the managers of the hotel should travel to Dubai and see what 4 star cleanliness looks like. The bathroom, behind the toilet, behind s underneath the mirror... thick with grey dust. The bed head thick with dust. The mattress slides around and the bed frame is thick and dirty with dust. Not just dusty... real thick been there for a very long time dust.The beds are comfy but the pillows are literally none existent.. they are feather based and need to be replaced ASAP. 4 nights ... zero sleep.. ended up rolling one of my jumpers for a pillow. Told by reception all pillows were the same so no point them sending another ... great. Security at the hotel pick and chose when they ask you for your card. My 2 teenagers used to stay downstairs and come up after us, they wasn’t once asked for the room card any evening until the 4th night at which point they were prevented from entering the lift by the guard and I had to travel down to come get them. Not an issue.... but really 2 16 year old British kids a huge threat? The guy told me it was policy and everyone after 6pm was to show their card. This didn’t happen. I was told by another guest it was because they house people from the shelter in the hotel. Think that’s a great thing to do but I would have like to know before I stayed. I don’t think I would have picked this hotel from the huge choice available if I had been aware of this. Another thing to be aware of is the ‘ Amenity tax that is payable when you leave the hotel.. we were there 4 days and I think it’s was about $125 dollars. Wasn’t aware of this and I am told by the reception that it’s for calls, ice and the gym. We didn’t use any of these. Just be aware. Overall a pretty standard hotel, great pics for the gram if that’s what rocks your world however it’s not great once you get in the lift. We felt let down the room and the space shown in the photos doesn’t exist in real life and the basics you expect are no where to be seen.A cheap base. Nothing more ",1/15/19,2
"I really dont like leaving poor reviews. However the experience i had in this hotel purely because of the person next door let me down. The staff i spoke to couldn’t have been nicer so cant fault that. The lounge/lobby looked spectacular and looked a 5 star hotel in a fantastic location just off times square however its when you go up the lift/elevator the problems occur, the rooms need upgraded and painted etc however i dont really care about those things it was just somewhere to sleep at night. However with the walls so thin i could hear the neighbour blasting music till 4am and crying and as well as what sounded like argueing with another guest possibly over the noise. So hardly had any sleep because of him. I was going to complain to reception about the noise however i didnt want to cause another issue ",1/15/19,2
"The location is perfect, everything is close , the rooms are clean and no noise at all All the staf is very helpful The check in was the easiest also the checkoutAnd the decoration very nice Love this hotel ",1/15/19,5
The rooms that I've started in are small. Particularly with two full sized beds. There was barely enough room to move with two couples sharing a room. The service staff was excellent however. City Market is convenient and they gave some great food options,1/15/19,4
"Brilliant central location, very close to Times Square and Hell's Kitchen. Easy to get around from there. Asked to be changed room as initial room was a bit run down. Lovely reception staff and they arranged for us to be moved to a different room which was better. Great WIFI throughout the hotel. Helpful concierge. We didn't eat there, but did have drinks at the bar. Flat diet coke, but barmen helpful and friendly. There was a band on Thursday night which were good. Rooms are a bit tired, with chipped furniture, paintwork etc, but the bed was very comfortable. Biggest gripe is that the heating / air con was very noisy as it kicked in each time. Not great during the night when you are trying to sleep. Would I stay here again? Absolutely. It was great value for a very central location in New York, especially if you are just looking for a basic hotel as a base. Hopefully the heating will be fixed next time ",1/15/19,3
"worse room ever. super noisy air condition! the bar is super expensive. i take two coffee and two yogurt for 30$! Unbelievableand more, the taxes were not included and i was expected to spend 400$ and not 700$ ",1/15/19,1
The location is amazing and the rate is very good for the room. Also sugar factory is great place to buy desserts. Iconic M (general store) is open 24/7 which is very good. The room is clean and staff are very kind,1/15/19,4
"Arrived at Row around 3.40pm, small queue at check in, took about 30 minutes to get to desk, as we had to wait we where given vouchers for 2 complimentary drinks at the bar. Room comfortable and clean just what you need, beds comfortable and showers lovely. Busy hotel but doesn’t affect you when in your room. Staff all very friendly and willing to help. Would definitely stay here again on our next visit ",1/14/19,5
Room was comfortable and location is great for central NYC. Room was not serviced properly on arrival and a couple of teh bathroom fixtures looked a bit tired. Reception staff were a little curt and off.,1/14/19,3
It's our 2nd time staying at the ROW.. it's now definitely our favorite hotel whenever we're in NYC... absolutely the complete package... I'd avoid the in house convenience store though... astronomical prices for things you could get for a third of the price across the road...,1/13/19,5
"We had a good stay at the Row NYC. Nothing out of the ordinary for NYC. Rooms were small but equipped properly. The bathroom was tight, but what more can you ask for. We stayed on the 17th floor with our window facing 8th ave. VERY LOUD but it didn't bother us any. Elevator system is unique. The security guard at the base of the elevators was a nice safety touch but slightly annoying. Check in was smooth, got there before a rush so I would imagine it to be slow with only 1 person waiting. Check your credit card statements!!! there are more fees than the price of a nights stay. If I had known this I would have stayed somewhere else. They also charge for a nights stay 1-2 days before your even there. There isn't anything super special about it that makes it better than anywhere else. Just an average hotel ",1/13/19,3
"rooms are a bit small but that what you get in the city! i was able to check in early with no charge, the rooms were clean, and in the PERFECT area! i highly recommend staying here. there was little to no noise at all from the city ",1/13/19,4
I recommend this hotel to anybody visiting for family and friendsMy stay was so awesome I loved the hotel and its views. The views were breath taking and they’re are really good restaurants above the hote,1/13/19,5
"Being our first time in New York we didn't have a clue where or what. As we arrived at The Row which was our first hotel of four, we met Junior who works at reception. We felt right at home. He was so professional yet the most friendly person we met in our month in the US. He was infact so helpful that we decided to cancel our other hotel for our second week in NY and booked The Row again. When we arrived our second time he recognised us, and again, we felt right at home and special to know that he still remembered us. We had a wonderful time, all thanks to your friendly Junior. We would recommend this hotel with a smile. The location is great aswell, just a block away from Time Square and our view was so pretty. Ps. If you ever check in at The Row, ask for Junior ;)Thanks Row, we will defnitely see you again ",1/13/19,5
"Must pay an additional “amenities” fee for every night that you stay here (around $34USD per night). The rooms are small with no fridge.We had no hot water for the duration of our stay even after contacting reception multiple times. Our shower stopped working twice and had to be fixed twice, meaning we were unable to shower before heading out in the morning on two occasions. I would not recommend this hotel. ",1/13/19,1
"We had a decent stay. We arrived about three hours after check-in and the room we'd reserved weeks before had been sold; we were put in a smaller, cheaper room without the view. Latonya at the front desk was very kind and compensated us for part of our stay, but it meant we had to vacate the room early the next day to move rooms. Further disorganization: no one could agree whether checkout time was 11, 11:30, or noon.The heater in the bathroom could not be completely shut off, and was so close to the toilet that we had to shuffle in sideways to sit, and managed to burn ourselves a few times.The rooms seem to have been updated recently but lots of shortcuts have been made.The rooms (toilets, sinks, beds) and the rest of the facility were more or less clean, but there are some areas that have been neglected- behind the beds, shower edgings, etc.All staff we encountered were kind and helpful, and we felt very safe within the hotel. The view was great (once we were moved to the right room), and the beds were very comfortable ",1/12/19,3
"My family stayed three nights at Row NYC. We like it because of its location in the theatre district. In addition, It had great winter rates. We found the staff to be helpful and are rooms were clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay there again! ",1/12/19,5
Everything is excellent as always. As I stated earlier girlfriend and I always stay at the hotel whether it’s for business or pleasure. It is close to everything from time square to great restaurants and easy access to the subway,1/12/19,5
"We stayed here for 3 nights, we arrived at 11 am and the hotel check in wasn't until 4 pm they province a luggage store and the staff there were very friendly and helpful. The room was fairly small but not a problem we only slept there the beds were very comfy. It could do with a good deep clean but I won't be too picky as the location is fantastic for all attractions . There are water/ice machines at various points throughout the hotel. You can request a kettle. Security is good on a night and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. The reception area gets very busy and sometimes you will have to wait for an elevator.The food court opposite does great coffee and quick easy food for reasonable prices.All in all it was a great trip thoroughly enjoyed by all and yes we would stay here again. ",1/12/19,3
"Room was bigger than many NYC rooms I've stayed in, although very basic. Small bathroom. All in all it was exactly what we needed as we do not spend much time in our room and the bed was comfortable. Price was also great ",1/12/19,5
"I was quite concerned about our stay at this hotel after reading some of the previous review, however after arriving and spending our stay in NYC I am glad to confirm there was nothing to worry about. When we arrived we were checked in by the friendliest or staff who got us a room with plenty of space. Rooms were basic and have everything you need, very clean and bathroom was spacious for four girls and clean also. View from our window was right on the street where you could see all the views, and windows were sound proofed enough the noise of the traffic didn’t disturb. Only thing was the heating when switched on would rattle quite abit and could get loud, however room heated up very quickly so wasn’t on for long! Staff were great and friendly and we had no problems at all throughout our stay. Location is excellent, right beside Times Square and lots of bars, restaurants and shops right at our door. Also close to subway/bus/train which was great for commute to and from airport and to the Jersey outlet. We have had a fantastic stay and would have no doubts about staying in this hotel again! Some of the previous reviews do not do this hotel justice ",1/11/19,5
"Stayed New Year’s Day for a week, first impressions were ok, the receptionist we dealt with was not very welcoming or helpful, asked for credit card for the tax that had to be paid , they did not accept cash apparently! Given very little information on facilities, Our room was clean , beds very comfortable, bathroom adequate, AC and heating in the room, cleaned every day and very acceptable, meant to be given drinks bottles so I understand, we had some plastic cups left in our room, we found an ice and water machine on the 23 rd floor,don’t buy bottled water from the onsite shop as we were charged $6 a bottle, which we obviously declined , not knowing water was available elsewhere, Although a few moans, the hotel was clean,lively , and a great location for time square, one block away, onsite restaurant,coffee, bar gym , On checking out, all other receptionist were very helpful ",1/11/19,3
I visited Roy hotel during christmas eve i arrived at 12 pm but the reception refused to check in only at 4 pm if my room available it means i have to wait till 9 pm maybe. Other issues that its very crowded queues in the check in desk and only 1 or 2 staff available. The room not as showen in pics its small the bath room was not as clean as should be. I came every evening to the room but almost for 4 days bed sheet not changed or pillows cover. No water provided or coffee machine nor frig as well. The check in staff told me that my total stay cost 1200 $ and when i arrived they ask me to pay 1900 $ i dnt know how its jump 700$ extra ???? . only advantage is location and security ..,1/11/19,1
"Overall the hotel was pretty good. The room is small, and the bathroom door did not close all the way. It was reasonably clean, but could have been better.The best part of the stay was our hotel associate, Pawla. They did not have the room type we reserved available, so she upgraded us. She spent extra time with us, looking around at all the available rooms to find us the one with the best view. The view did not disappoint! We could see for blocks and blocks. She was kind, helpful, and took extra effort to make sure we were taken care of ",1/11/19,4
"Stayed here in Jan 2017. Hotel is fairly big with a nice lobby and tidy bar area. Room was smallish but what we expected being in NYC Was clean and comfy, had a slight issue with the heating and safe on arrival however the maintenance staff came to the room within 20 minutes and sorted. Location was great, walking distance to many of the main attractions and literally 5 minutes from Times Square, would stay here again should we return to NY ",1/10/19,4
"With an ""upgraded"" remove, we had a broken lock, broken sink drain, stained linens (make-up on towels and pillow cases) and blood on the sheets. The ""continental breakfast"" consists of one drink, one pastry (not all that special) and one piece of fruit ",1/10/19,1
These rooms are small and some very loud. They are located in a great location in midtown and are a fair value for that. Do not expect more than bare minimum when it comes to accommodations. The bathrooms are clean and have had minor upgrades. It’s ok of a night or two but the rooms are very small.,1/10/19,3
"Enjoyed our stay at the Row Hotel, a recommendation by a friend who lives in New York. The rooms were bright, clean, and welcoming. The location is perfect - we walked to Broadway in 10 minutes, Central Park in 20 minutes, and Penn Station in under 20 minutes. Plenty of places to eat in the vicinity. The only drawback was the slowness of the check-in line, and the lack of Concierge (presumably on a break) for 15 minutes before we gave up and went without Concierge. We also tried to check bags after we checked out, so that we wouldn't have to drag them around NYC, but the line was excruciatingly long, and we gave up on that, too, and dragged our bags around. Despite this, I'd definitely stay at the Row Hotel again. The excellent room and location more than make up for some inconveniences. By the way, the breakfast - phenomenal, and not overpriced ",1/10/19,4
"Stayed 3 nights, two weeks before Christmas. Room was larger than expected. This hotel has a great and friendly staff. They allowed us to drop off our luggage and have an early check in even though we did not request or pay for one. They also kept our luggage safe for the better part of a day due to us having a late flight. The location of this hotel is awesome! You are within pretty much walking distance of anything you would want to do. Would recommend this hotel ",1/10/19,4
"excellent service, amazing location. the people must try the gym, that is so complete, for the daily meals have to be included in the hotel, the service room is fast, the managers help the people in everything, they help me always when i dont no how to go to visist turistic place ",1/10/19,5
"We stayed for 2 nights at the end of December and 1 night the first weekend in January. We arrived about 6.30pm on the 27th December the hotel was very busy, our first room we had was tiny, 2 double beds and not much more room. Not ideal for a family of 4. As we were all so tired we jut went to bed. There was a fan noise right outside our bedroom window which kept us awake all night, in the end we all just got up at 3.30am. I went down to reception to ask if we could move rooms, I was asked to come back at 7am. As no new rooms were available we had to put our cases in storage in the basement and our new room was available later on that day. The new room was a little more spacious, but still quite small for a family room. What I'd not realised when we booked the hotel was that all the rooms were pretty much small. this room had a view which was better than the brick wall we looked out on to before. The room on our return was similar to the room we had on the second night of our previous stay, but this room had a proper bathroom door that closed as opposed to the sliding doors that we'd previously had that kept sliding back open. The rooms are pretty basic, no tea or coffee facilities (not sure if you get these in any other hotels in the US) and water you had a little hotel water bag that you could fill up if you wanted some. The bar was nice we has a drink in there one afternoon. The WIFI was good and the girls liked the use of the iMac's in the lobby. The staff were all friendly and helpful, bar the concierge desk who we asked if they could arrange for our bags to be brought up to our room, we was advised we needed to sort that ourselves by going down stairs and arranging it. Bit confused by that, as we thought that was what concierge was there for. Overall we was happy with the hotel, it was just a base for us and we wasn't planning on being in it for other than sleeping. The hotel is a very busy hotel, so if you prefer something a little more quieter then I'd say it's not for you. I'd say this hotel is more suitable for solo, business and couples ",1/10/19,3
First trip to NYC and had great experience at Row! Room was very small but clean. Hidden gem restaurant (food court) off of lobby that we didn’t discover until the last morning. Hotel bar was great! Everyone was very pleasant and hospitable,1/9/19,5
"Big lines for checking, my room was completely nasty, there was other guests underwear inside the drawers (very likely used), employees were not gentil (except Junior at the front desk).... In summary, I don't recommend this hotel to anybody ",1/9/19,1
"Great location, friendly staff, clean and tidy, the most comfortable beds and pillows ever, Lobby Bar provided free entertainment and drink prices were excellent. Definitely stay there again. Rooms are small but compared to others in New York this is standard. Traffic noise level was also good and blackout blinds ",1/9/19,5
Definitely recommend this place for your future stay in NYC. The view was great and it was so close to everything. The staff was so attentive and made our stay so pleasant and easy to check in and check ou,1/9/19,5
Never again this hotel!!!! Very unfriendly employees! Too expensive for this small rooms!!! I‘ve booked a room with kind size bed but don‘t get it!!! But i have to pay the same price as for a kind size bed room!!!,1/9/19,1
This was a nice place for a short weekend visit in NYC what they don't tell you is they hold $200 on card for incidentals . Not worth it bathroom is small and room is very small no leg room with 2 twin beds take up whole room plus no real outlet to charge device,1/8/19,2
"We arrived as a group of 4 booking 2 rooms. Upon arrival, we were booked in by Zac who was really friendly and knowledgeable when we asked questions about the area etc. Although it was busy upon our arrival, Zac took his time with us and we didn't feel rushed through booking process. As it was my sister's 40th birthday, Row NYC upgraded her to a bigger room and provided her with a complimentary bottle of prosecco which was a really nice touch! Our room was basic but clean and all the amenities were working fine. Yes the room was small, but come on, this is New York! you're not going to be staying in your room all day are you!! Its just somewhere to crash! I was actually happy with the cleanliness of the room in general and the fact the cleaners came in every day and left fresh towels if we needed them.We went to the bar area once, had one drink and were a bit horrified at how expensive it was! We ended up nipping across the road to Smith's bar where the drink was more reasonably priced. This hotel is in a perfect location, literally round the corner from Broadway and Times Square. We will definitely be back to stay at Row NYC.I also feel I need to add some comments at the end, I saw another travellers review who said homeless people stayed on the lower ground...this was news to me! I actually didn't see any evidence of this, not that it would be an issue anyway as security in the reception is quite good. For a start you have to show your room key to security before you can get into the lift and there are plenty of security guards around. Additionally there are a few comments about the extra charges (facility fee) - Row NYC make no secret about the facility fee - we booked our holiday via a travel agent who did mention the fee, it was on our paperwork too and is on the hotels web page. Yes it sucks to have to pay another amount on top but if you do your homework, this is clearly explained to you ",1/8/19,4
"Good location but overpriced for what it is , very small room , bar prices are ridiculously expensive .No room facilities for making tea or coffee , hot water never worked properly and shower very poor ",1/8/19,3
"Stayed here as a family, 6 people 5 rooms. All rooms allocated were totally filthy, one room had actual human excrement on the bathroom floor. Another had black mould on the bathroom walls & door frame. Another had nose bogeys on the light switches. They were simply filthy. My room had cockroaches in the bathroom and on the shower curtain. I handled the cockroach situation until the last one, which I unfortunately trapped half it’s body with an ice bucket. I reported this to management, who told me that everything would be cleaned & rectified for when we came back from our day out... IT WASNT!!! Upon our return, all rooms were the same, except for the towels being changed. So the cleaning staff had been in & not cleaned anything! In fact, they had ignored the half captured/squashed cockroach in the middle of the room, despite the situation being reported. What kind of a dump is this “Hotel”? Well, I’ll tell you. It’s a massive dump where floors 4-6 are actually a homeless shelter. That’s right, homeless people are wandering about in this hotel. Virgin Atlantic either forgot to mention that or don’t know about it. ☹️On our last 2 nights we could smell weed in our corridor, it was so strong that we rung down to reception when we could even smell it in our rooms. This place is more hostel than hotel. I felt dirty & unclean throughout my 4 night stay, as did the rest of our party. That’s not the New York experience I was expecting for the money we paid! I’ll look forward to a response from this review ",1/8/19,1
"Really lovely hotel within easy reach of broadway shows and other attractions. No problem checking in fast and efficient, rooms no problem for a couple been in smaller in NYC, clean tidy fresh looking. The lobby/bar/kitchen area are welcoming with a good atmosphere(maybe my lucky day), like kitchen food ideas different food outlets letting you choose what you eat and then sit tougher. Anybody worried about security dont be people checking you have a key. Overall i would stay again ",1/8/19,5
"The staff was welcoming. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We were given an upgrade and a free continental breakfast. It is located steps from Times Square, Restaurant Row, and all of the Broadway shows. We love it ",1/7/19,5
"The room we were given was very small, not what we were expecting. The bathroom was tiny with a bath and shower which we found just about adequate. Down stairs we found it just about adequate. The breakfast was contenental, which was ok but not much choice. The plus point for the hotel is its location it is very close to Times Square and Broadway, a short walk away. Other tourist attractions are accessible within walking distance. There is a bar across the road called Smiths Bar which we found ok for drinks price wise and the staff were friendly. One warning I will give is the fact of the location of the hotel you pay a tax because it is in the Times Square area which works out approx £250 for 7 nights. W ",1/7/19,3
"All I can say is wow. I have never stayed in such a filthy, disgusting and down right hideous ""hotel"" in my life. In reality this place is like a youth hostel. We stayed for 4 nights as a family, 6 people and we had 5 rooms between us. All of our rooms were so filthy that we felt unclean throughout our entire stay. So, what was wrong? Dirty bed sheets, the bathroom was so filthy I can't imagine it has been cleaned since the 1980's. Cockroaches, human excrement on the bathroom floor, bodily fluids and other hideous nasties. There was black mould in my room, but that was the most minor issue compared to the human waste on the bathroom floor and stains on my bedding. We continually complained to no avail, the room did not get any cleaner.It is a homeless shelter on the lower floors. This needs to made clear to holiday makers before booking.The rooms are tiny, filthy and entirely inadequate. Please, do yourselves a favour and do not stay here. You don't feel safe and it isn't clean. Someone on our corridor was smoking weed so intensively that I almost keeled over with the smell. I am amazed Virgin Holidays list this hotel. Next stop, formal complaint to them. This ""hotel"" ruins your New York experience. Book elsewhere. You have been warned ",1/7/19,1
"I traveled to NYC with my kid and spent 4 nights at the Row NYC. First, a shout out to Zac at reception who upgraded us to 2 full beds when our queen standard room wasn't available upon our arrival. The location is great, literally around the corner from the Broadhurst where we saw Anastasia. Big Bus stop was also very close. The room was clean, beds comfy. The heater in the room was a but noisy on the first night, but it kept us warm in January, and soon we learned to ignore the sound. The lobby is busy and a bit odd with steps from the ground level entry, but that too was a small inconvenience for all the other definite pluses of the location. Also a walking distance from the Penn Station where we arrived at from EWR. Took an uber to LGA ",1/7/19,4
"Rooms are really small, even the more pricey/big ones. Cleanliness not always good, in both rooms and public spaces. Very crowded. Position is great for tourists who want to visit the center of manhattan, plus metro station and bus port authority are just around the corner ",1/7/19,3
Close walk to all major Christmas sights and just a short cab ride to Canal street and Little Italy. Standard room was tight and could not fit our pack-n-play. Staff was helpful and friendly and the hotel was neat and clean,1/7/19,4
"How can we be so discourteous, so outrageous. Rooms reserved but not available, dirty toilets, drawers idem, a payment made without consulting us, and there with excedent nearly 300 dollars. All this with a staff of the reception Absolutely bad. Yes, the concierge ... in this period, it is very useful, but never there ",1/7/19,1
"A broken bottle of whiskey disappeared in the room. the empty bottle on the floor remained lying. The staff damaged our luggage, did not apologize and replaced the damage. The location is good for a trip to NYC ",1/7/19,2
Left not happy and unsatisfied for the stay compared to value! Small rooms and cleaning services isn’t good. Tv losses signal sometimes and wifi isnt fast enough. overall i would choose another hotel next time,1/6/19,2
"We were very well received by Junior at check in, where he advised us and recommended several places close by and quality for our meals. They were great tips and we really enjoyed it. Also with the issue of the displacement and visitation of various sights.We were very pleased with our stay at the Hotel ",1/6/19,5
"DO NOT STAY HERE, just look at the picture. The homeless live on floors 3-7, we didn’t know this until 2 days in. It is disgusting, unclean, small rooms, the pictures show cockroaches, blood, dried nasal mucus, feces and dirt. We paid £1300 each x 6 for 4 nights we did not expect this. I repeat DO NOT STAY HERE!! ",1/6/19,1
My second stay there. Will certainly return if I need to stay in nYC. Great location and price. Easy to get to. Room simple but had all that I needed. Will stay there again if I am visiting NYC. Have suggested it to friends,1/6/19,5
"Nice rooms, staff were super helpful throughout our stay. Willing to hold baggage before and after check out. Clean enough, big enough, surrounded by great food and theaters. I have no complaints except for the slow internet ",1/5/19,5
Hotel location excellent for access to Broadway and places of interest by foot. Hotel facilities good. Rooms cleaned to a good standard. Lifts great when system understood could be explained clearer on check in how to access room. Would stay again and would recommend hotel to others,1/5/19,4
"Great hotel for the price and location! Right around the corner from 42nd Street, Hells Kitchen and subway stop. Staff was incredibly helpful and welcoming. Have already recommended to my brother and I would definitely stay again. Nice Chic atmosphere ",1/5/19,4
Dssapointed that I paid for a superior room and received a standard. Promised a partial refund which I have not received. In my opinion for adding a breakfast package you pay a lot of money for what you actually receive. You get a hot drink or juice a piece of fruit and a choice of 4 pastries. Other than that room clean and comfortable and in a good location,1/5/19,3
Affordable for a Manhattan hotel. Great location. Very busy area surrounded by amenities. Front end staff could have been warmer and friendlier. Heater made loud clanging and pinging noises. Had to turn it off,1/5/19,3
"The ROW was not just a hotel, it was an experience filled with charismatic staff and a variety of curriculars and festivities to engage in. They are very misleading in terms of the pricing and rates that are advertised online specifically ",1/4/19,4
"This is a very convenient hotel, near everything. The rooms are small but comfortable. There is a bar and food court in building and the staff is accommodating. It is onebblock over from the heart of Broadway ",1/4/19,4
"Our first experience with your hotel was receiving a hotel key that opened up another persons room. All of their belongings were in the room. Apparently the customers were suppose to move rooms but never did. Luckily, it was an honest family that walked into their room. I am sure the sable leather bag sitting on the chair would have been stolen otherwise. Once we went back down stairs and received another key we waited for about an hour for the bell man to bring up our bags. We called the service desk twice, concerned they were going to the wrong room. The woman that answered said she would look into it, after about a half an hour my husband called and the same woman answered again she said she would call us back when she found our luggage but never did. It finally arrived 30 minutes later, but no follow up call from the service desk as promised. The next morning we came down for the breakfast we paid, to be included in our hotel stay. We were astonished to see that our choices were one pastry, bottled drink, and a piece of fruit. There was hardly room for all of us to sit with a party of 9 but the awful breakfast (which we do not consider that breakfast) was atrocious. We would have saved our money and gone to Pick a bagel everyday if your breakfast choices had been disclosed to us. Absolutely, unacceptable and deceiving that your company markets that as a breakfast.On new years day we went out to grab dinner from across the street and when we returned the alarms were going off in the hotel. We had to eat our dinner standing up in the lobby. Once the elevator were working again we saw the water pouring in from the cealing of elevator A. This was very concerning to us as I am pregnant and there is no possible way I could walk up or down 23 flights of stairs if necessary. We decided to stay in the hotel rather than watch the ball drop due to the elevator situation. It would be better for me to be stuck in the room pregnant than on the streets of NYC ",1/4/19,1
The ROW NYC is what could be a great value but falls short because of a fatal flaw the beds are terribly uncomfortable! Small rooms are to be expected in a mid-town hotel and the staff is great but the comfort of their guests seems to be lacking,1/4/19,2
"Despite some glitches the staff was awesome , friendly,service excellent, location perfect . Rooms clean cleaning service friendly and efficient . Food service and staff experienced and efficient and friendly . Security friendly and on point. ",1/4/19,5
"The rooms are very small, we had four people in our room (two adults two teenagers), the bathroom was so tiny. The aircon was so noisy we couldn’t have it on and my Aunty who was also staying at the hotel had the same problem with her aircon. The rooms don’t have a fridge or tea/coffee making facilities. We were there for NYE and for the exuberant price they charged we felt it wasn’t worth it. Rooms are more suitable for two people only. Check in is at 4pm, the hotel stored our bags until we could check in, but when we did check in it took an hour for the bags to be delivered to our room. ",1/4/19,1
"Staff, location and amenities all amazing. Would definitely recommend. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Location is in the theatre district and one block awat from Times Square. Plenty food options in the hotel ",1/3/19,5
My wife was rushed into booking this hotel from flight centre the following day i contacted the flight centre to change the hotel but they was very unhelpful. So we was stuck with the Row Hotel and what a nightmare it was . Traveled with my wife and 2 daughters arrived to be given our superior king room which sleeps 4 so flight centre said what a joke no floor space and the bathroom you could not turn around in room was dirty so i went straight down and joined the queue at reception only to see that most of the people in front of me was complaining as well seem to be a common thing because soon as i said the room was much to small the guy said yes they are not surprised at all . He said we have other rooms in other hotels around the corner but they are not much better in the end he gave us a disability room the following morning . The noise was unbearable the room was dirty and after 1 night in there myself and 1 of my daughters was violently sick all night and spent the following day in bed being sick missing a show we had booked . The following day my wife and other daughter fell sick as well and my daughter was sick on the plane home .The maid come in and made the bed and that was it the sides were filthy and the carpets were dirty toilet was dirty and around the bath was horrible . Police hang out in the reception couple of the floors are for homeless people.My wife ordered a drink at the bar which is a pressco topped with a small amount of fruit juice the bar man filled the glass with fruit juice and put a cap full of pressco in it and charged her 16 dollars we stood there watching him do it so she complained straight away and he tried to say that he had filled it up with pressco then gave in and said sorry and gave her some money back . We travel a lot and i would never recommend this hotel and be very careful of the flight centre,1/3/19,1
"The hotel is in a great location - Times Square is within walking distance and getting to the tube is super easy too. There's even a Shakeshack right opposite which seems to be open 24/7! The wifi is good, they have a bar and a place where you can get sweets but also proper food which is reasonably priced. They have a great luggage hold system (tip how much you want) which is good when you have to check out but want to spend a little time exploring the area. However, in terms of the hotel itself - it really needs to work on its cleanliness. Our hotel bathroom was gross and had hair in the bath tub which we had to complain about and it was cleaned the next day. The room was super small, which given that you're not really there to stay in your room isn't too bad, but it is annoying that you can’t really get from one side of the room to the other without banging your foot on something. The most annoying thing about our stay was how noisy the hotel is - and it’s not the residents or the road, it was the lift! Our room was to the side of the lifts and all through the night you could hear it going up and down and just generally loud noises which was soo annoying when you were exhausted from travelling all day. Another aspect I was disappointed with was the doorman on the day we were leaving obviously have links with specific taxi drivers, and the driver he had take us to JFK was so rude but also crass with his driving (a woman actually spat (!) at his car because he nearly banged into her car) really made me question the doorman and the hotel. Overall, the hotel is in a great location and has good facilities, however suffers due to its lack of cleanliness, noise and hospitality ",1/3/19,3
"Visited during Christmas week - needless to say an extremely busy time. Staff generally had things under control. When we had an issue with our room (TV mounted at awkward angle), Yarra took very good care of us. She made sure to follow up and check that we were happy. She remembered us all the way thru our stay and I made a point to thank her as we were checking out and leaving. A 5 star employee! ",1/3/19,4
"Rooms are full of dust,noisy , cold at night and bathroom are not clean Horrible. I will never recommend this hotel to one of my friend I sent an email to the hotel when I was at the beginning of my holidays but no one answered ",1/3/19,1
A very nice location close to every important place of New York. Excelent service and breakfast. The room is confortable but maybe kind of small. The cleaning service is good. Check in and check out its very fast. I will recomend the hotel.,1/3/19,4
"Check took over an hour of waiting. Front desk girl was rude. The king room I reserved was not available. Gave us a room with 2 doubles. Bathroom was dirty and had no shower curtain. Second trip to front desk was even worse and was told the king room had been given to someone else. I held my ground and she eventually found a king room, which was much better. I refused to deal with the front desk counter after that. I witnessed them being rude and unenthusiastic with many guest. Wouldn’t recommend this hotel even though location is good. Dealing with u helpful front desk leaves a bad taste for travelers. ",1/2/19,3
"The cleaning of our room was very bad. Either the staff were lazy or didn't know how to clean properly. We couldn't open the window and had some bad air in the room. Just because you paint everything with paint in your room, it doesn't get cleaner. If you don't do something quickly, guests run away from you. In New York, the competition is not shaming. For us it was the first time and the last time in the ROW ",1/2/19,1
Reception queues long and poorly staffed by unhelpful people. Never answer phone if you try to call. This was the only spoiler on an otherwise excellent trip. Good base location with decent rooms just needs happier staff,1/2/19,3
We loved our stay here. We stayed on the 25th floor which had a fun view of the city. The location was excellent. Close to Times Square and all the shows and several places to eat nearby. We would stay here again! Thx!,1/2/19,5
"On check-in found bathroom was dirty, we requested it he cleaned arrived back to room and it still wasn't done all that had been done was bin emptied. During our 3 night stay room was not cleaned once and we had to request clean towels on the third night and had to wait over 70 mins for them to be delivered. Hotel has a fantastic location and reception area is very nice bar seems really nice too. Rooms are a great size for NYC and a good standard.The bad cleaning and lack of housekeeping let it down. Was disappointing after reporting bathroom issue it still was not cleaned. Hotel did waive facilities fee on checkout after we explained our issues ",1/1/19,3

Stayed recently between Christmas and New Years. The hotel was in a great location for the shows we were going to see and things we wanted to do. Staff was professional and room was clean. Would stay again and recommend,12/31/18,5
"Small rooms, very clean, nice staff, great location. Right down the street from all theaters, Juniors restaurant and time square. Check in staff very friendly, had live music at night that was enjoyable and felt happy after a long day in the city. ",12/31/18,5
Hotel is nice and clean. You have to make sure to stay on top of room service and ask for what you want. Nice lobby and is very close to Times Square. Good tv but not all rooms have good views of the city,12/30/18,4
"Stayed at the Row with my brother for 4 nights over Christmas - have been to NYC many times so knew in advance of this hotel’s great location.We had requested twin rooms which weren’t available on our arrival on 23rd Dec. So had to share a king bed.We put up with this for the sake of not spoiling our holiday - and were told that a twin room would be available the next day. Receptionist was extremely rude and dismissive the next morning....surprise surprise no twin available! Again told there would be availability the next morning - at 7.30am next morning I asked the receptionist (a different lady from the day before) for a twin roomShe said there would be one available at 4pm that day, and I would have to check out immediately of our existing room and check back in at 4pm - as they were unable to hold two rooms for us at the same time! This lady was even more abrupt and dismissive than her colleague the day before - no empathy, no support, terrible attitude. Bearing in mind this was now Christmas Day - and we were expected to be without a room for the following 8 hours....I politely declined their ‘offer’. Positive - the rooms were very clean (if very small).....the maids were very polite and eager to help.....location was greatNegative - extremely rude reception staff (all 3 who we had come in to contact with)No empathy, no help, attitude like Basil Faulty (why are you even pestering me with this issue?! )If you want a hotel around the same location, try the many 100’s around this area ....and avoid the Row ",12/30/18,1
"We stayed at Row NYC for 5 nights, the location of the hotel is excellent, staff were friendly and helpful and the room was extremely clean. WiFi super fast and beds extremely comfortable, what more could you ask for? ",12/30/18,5
"First, the reservation accuracy was not correct. We had to solve by ourselves the checking date accuracy with booking.com. Second, the room was not the correct of our upgrade. Although everybody from the hotel said that our room was that we paid. Third, serious drug, maybe dealing and security problems inside the hotel. A room next to ours was a dealing or a drug spot of weed (marijuana, maconha). The smell was unbearable. The security ineffective against this problem. Several people on the corridor in front of this room, only standing by at the door. Very suspicious. Fourth, after the drug problems, at 6:00 am we woke up with yelling and screaming at the corridor. And also a very strong smell of weed. Fifth, finally we changed the room to what we initially paid, a king deluxe with a view, at 26th floor. Sixth, the staff tried to soften the situation. But at the last night of our stay, at 2:00 am we woke up with somebody putting the bill under the door, making noise and knocking the door! Seventh, we paid in cash. After 3 days of the check out, here in Brazil, we checked our credit card balance and saw that the hotel just charged us again, but now on our credit card bank account! Totaling almost 9,000 reais! That we already paid in cash, dollars, at the hotel in NYC! Until we do not have even an answer from the hotel ",12/29/18,2
"Went to NYC girls/family trip. The elevators were so slow and so small that we had to wait through 3-4 cars and often had to split up after 3-4 went by. Great location to Times Square. Small beds. Room tiny, bathroom minuscule. Shabby but overall clean. If you learn on having activity filled days, it works ",12/29/18,3
"Would not stay here again staff were very unfriendly and rude they only wanted to help if you were willing to pay or tip them more money, they all looked miserable! At check in the receptionist took my card off me to pay the balance of the room, not mentioning they take an extra $100 off the card which then gets put back on the card in 10-12 days time I only found this out after overhearing a conversation. I understand this may be hotel policy but I think this should be mentioned when paying. The hotel was not cheap to stay in only thing which was worth paying for was the location. Room and bathroom were tiny hard to move around when you have suitcases with you. Breakfast was disappointing! Coffee was disgusting would not bother wasting time going there for breakfast ",12/29/18,2
"Chose the Row NYC for my stay in New York as the positioning of the hotel was excellent could walk almost everywhere and was right beside both bus stops for the tour busses. Hotel was very clean and rooms were very cosy, would highly recommend to anyone staying in New York to choose this hotel ",12/29/18,5
"I mean it had everything you come to expect from a hotel. The room was clean and tidy, had everything I wanted and was in time square. Negative things about this hotel was the size of the room, it’s tiny and two people barely fit with suitcases. Big thug/bouncers stand in the entrance and just make it uncomfortable to have a holiday feel. They do random walks up the hallways as if it’s school camp. Get rid of them. The service fee is for the things people on holidays do not use. Printing and computer use, gym (smells horrible) and internet which states it is free on every booking site I’ve come across so it is unnecessary. But since it’s New York they do have to scam you somehow. Stay in the upper west side and get the subway in, this hotel is way to busy and not worth the hassle of it all ",12/28/18,3
Junior is the best. Very handsome. We could leave our luggage there after the checkout to go see the town. The bed was very comfortable wish we could have more pillows for us. The price was ok. Would been better if we would of booked earlier,12/28/18,4
We stayed here for two nights pre xmas and found the rooms very basic and in need of some TLC. The bathroom was tiny you could just about have a shower and sit on the loo at the same time. Just a block away from Times Square the location however is very convenient,12/28/18,3
"On our way to Chicago we landed at NY and already booked the hotel at Home. After our visit we Found the hotel OK, but think that you can find better rooms as the one we had. On the other side it’s only for sleeping and with our family the hotel is perfect situated for visiting NY and it’s at the back of Time square. Maybe you better ask for a room at the back side, because on the street you herz the whole night sirenes from policy etc....But after all we are glad we took the hotel, because i have a limp leg and walking at crutches and this the perfect for visiting ",12/28/18,4
"I thought for the price I would get better. There was enough room to barely move, one step to the bathroom. The place was so small that I could almost touch all walls. The shower was so hard to maneuver, I thought I was going to break the handle if I pulled any harder on it. There wasn’t even a coffee maker. There wasn’t a coffee maker either.. super sad. For the price I paid I could have gotten a better hotel somewhere else. The only good part was the bed was very comfy and the view wasn’t too bad and the location was perfect. Only reasons I didn’t give it a one star. Would I stay here again, no, would I recommend this place... not really. ",12/28/18,2
Convenient location and great neighborhood. Staff are very helpful and professional. Nice place to stay but a bit old rooms. I visited this place with my kids Christmas vacation and rooms felt little consisted,12/28/18,4
"The hotels location was perfect, being right next to Times Square and a 10/15 min walk to Central Park. A subway only a couple of mins walk away too. I did however find the rooms a little tired and basic, although they were clean and comfortable. Breakfast was really nice too, with friendly staff. ",12/28/18,4
"Row NYC is a great deal for the location! The service was prompt, the decor was modern, and it was a great advantage to have a food hall with many reasonable but local options attached. You can definitely tell that it is an older building and that some parts of the renovation have been done to a higher standard than other parts. That being said, I slept incredibly well as the rooms were above expectation for bed comfort and blocking sound and light from outside. Overall, an exceptional value. Highly recommend for those who are looking to stay near Times Square ",12/27/18,4
"Great service! Very easy process checking in and getting settled. The hotel associate, Junior, was very attentive to our needs! He provided us with a great service. I highly recommend this hotel and Junior’s service ",12/27/18,5
"We arrived late, tired and cold. Caesar at the desk could not have been better. He made us feel welcomed, he set us up with a great room at a great rate and it was the start of a wonderful few days at Christmas time. The rooms are clean, the location is central and everyone on the staff makes you feel like you are welcomed to stay there ",12/27/18,5
The cleaness could be better. The carpets had a lot of stains. Heater was broken had to use an electrical one. Reception not friendly and slow. We waited more than 20 min in line. The room was not ready whem we got there,12/27/18,2
"Hotel was overall nice. Our room keys quit working a couple of times and I was told by concierge to wait in the check in line to have my key reprogramed. They should have another person to help with the guest that have already checked in. Bar was very comfortable and ""Kitchen"" was convenient for a quick meal - (DON'T by drinks at the gift shop - it was extremely expensive even for NYC - $15 for a Gatorade and apple juice.- ridiculous) The same apple juice was 1/2 the price in the ""Kitchen ",12/27/18,4
"The row needs better maid and maintenance service. I stayed here with my wife and 5 years old son. The room was filthy and we had to change rooms and that was the same, it took us 2 hrs... I had a bad experience staying at the row and will not recommend and return... ",12/27/18,1
"Growing up in New York I always remember the big 'M' that was atop the Milford Plaza hotel on 8th Avenue. The hotel has changed hands a few times and it is now called the Row NYC. I was fortunate to stay there for 4 nights fro December 22-26 and was pleasantly surprised with how it has been revamped.The room was spacious, the bedding was all white and the mattress one of the most comfortable that I have ever slept on and the room was immaculate.The bathroom was very clean and the staff all very friendly. Yes, it is a very large hotel, but the staff make it feel like you are staying in a small boutique hotel. I was able to leave my luggage upon check-out and, unlike many hotels in NYC, this service is free of charge for guests.The location of the hotel in the center of all the action of Broadway and Times Square is so convenient for exploring this great city. Thank you to all who made my stay during this period truly memorable. I give it a 10++ ",12/27/18,5
"stayed here for 4 nights just before Xmas and to some up rough round the edges however the location is key. Slap bang in the middle of times square so can walk to where ever you want from there as we did. we only needed transport downtown and to the airport. The rooms are spot on for what you need, considering the fact we were out all from morning to night. The reception is well done up and really looks the part, and we found all the staff to be helpful, in what was a very very busy hotel. Nothing really to complain about if your looking for 5* maybe so but that's not what we went to NYC for, and so all in all this hotel was perfect for such a fantastic Xmas getaway to NYC ",12/27/18,4
"This hotel was recommended to us by a friend , based on its location to all the sites. We were extremely happy it was so central to everything. It was clean , staff was friendly, we will return in the future . ",12/27/18,5
"This hotel is a great location to Times Square about a 5 minute walk! The rooms are a little small however perfect when your hardly ever in them and for the amazing price we got for the time we are here (Christmas and nye included) - our room was cleaned daily, lifts are always on time, there was no problem with check in - the reviews had me worried for a little bit! However, my time so far has been pleasent hopefully the rest will be as well : ",12/26/18,4
"Overall the experience was fine. There were a couple of minor issues with the carpet being wet and maintenance being done down the hall during the late morning, early afternoon but overall the hotel was great. ",12/26/18,4
"The room was amazing, but the reception was a little bit crowd, and the recepciones were not so helpful, the price was to expensive because of the tax, we expect one , and we receive 200,00 morenas a bil ",12/26/18,5
"Wonderful time and great people that run the hotel. The price was awesome for the time of year we went and good reviews on it, the food court was awesome also and very nice bar lounge area. I totally enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend it to other people ",12/26/18,5
Great location to Times Square and any place you want to walk to. The room was very small and the bathroom was dirty when we arrived. There was dirty towels in the sink and the bath tub looked very dirty.,12/26/18,3
The hotel is in a good location and walking distance to almost everywhere unless if u wanna get stuck on traffic with a taxi. Good stay just a few issues. The hotel is in desperate need of upgrading the rooms are dirty and the cleaners don’t clean properly. The bathrooms are very tiny with mould and dirty doors. The rooms are so hot and if u try the fan it makes a massively loud noise so u can’t sleep. The walls are paper thin and u can actually listen to someone’s tv and hear all the toilet flashing . The toilet is so old fashioned u feel like u are gonna sit on the water itself coz it’s so high up. There is a good eating place in the city kitchen if u can find a chair it’s always busy but they save everything is paper plates. Some of the food is served like prison food and just salty and not appetising at all. I suggest u get out and find plenty of restaurants. The choices are endless and u can eat in different places daily. I would not return here unless if they modernise it a bit coz the rooms are stuffy and dark creepy corridors until u get used to them. The security is great though in and out and you feel safe.,12/26/18,3
I booked the Row Hotel becuase of the affordable price around Christmas. I will never stay here again. I received an email that allowed me to upgrade at a cost. When we arrived to said “premium” room the sheets were dirty with makeup and other stains and we had to request that they be changed. There was a ring about the tub with mildew and what looked like mold. The heater make extremely loud sounds when turned on. For the price that I paid for said upgrade I could have gone elsewhere. Do yourselves a favor and stay anywhere else,12/26/18,2
In the heart of the theater district without being in the middle of the chaos. The rooms are small but other than a coffeemaker you want for nothing. The refillable water bottle flasks are very cool and environmentally smart if used properly,12/26/18,4
Very good location just a couple minutes to walk to broadway shows and Times Square. Rooms are a good size and clean. Hotel staff are friendly and helpful. Cost is excellent considering how close it is to everything. This is my second time staying here. This time I brought my family. I will stay here any time I visit the city in the future.,12/26/18,5
Good location to time square. Rooms like all in NY are small. But beds are comfy and white sheets. As we had the fire a block away you can hear the fire trucks at 6 am waking you up. No fault of the hotel but noise does carry up the building into your room. Good view of the city from our window.,12/26/18,4
"Located in the heart of the theater district this high rise hotel offers contemporary accommodations, an upscale food court , and spectacular views , if one gets a corner room. Fernanda checked us in and without asking we got room 2541, high enough to almost eliminate the din of honking horns , sirens , and construction work .The elevator system is modernistic but effective . The rooms are small yet comfortable.The shows we went to see were across the street which made this an excellent choice for those going to see Broadway productions . Midweek price of $140 was reasonable . Don’t bring your car . I think they charge $70 per day for parking and it’s not at the hotel  ",12/25/18,4
Beautifully clean hotel with great customer service Junior at the front desk and Delcy as a room attendant made my stay superior! They both deserve customer service awards! I will definitely be back again,12/25/18,5
My daughter and I went to NYC at Christmas time and chose The Row for our accommodations. We couldn’t have asked for anything better! Loved it! I will be telling everyone about The Row in NYC. It’s a great place to stay.,12/24/18,5
"Excellent hotel in the heart of Manhattan. Convenient to Times Square, Broadway shows, Fifth Ave. shopping, and the subway. Great value for the price, nicely updated rooms, & friendly staff. We always stay at Row when we visit NYC! Highly recommend ",12/24/18,5
"We stayed here for a long weekend a few weeks before Christmas. The location was the best! Close to Rockefeller Plaza and Times Square. The rooms were not big, but that's to be expected in NYC. The only complaint we had was the furnace made a LOT of noise. It was as if someone was trying to hammer their way out from the inside. It was incredibly loud and annoying at night. But everything else was nice ",12/24/18,5
"Let me start by saying I stayed here two years ago and it was amazing so it was a no brained to go back for this visit however something CLEARLY changed..We just got back from a weekend staying at ROW NYC and it was HORRIBLE. Only two people checking in with a line of 20 waiting, manager unresponsive, had to move rooms because a wall of power went out then a pot party across the hall required security (who did nothing) because you couldn’t walk past without getting high and at the end they overcharged my parking. That’s not even to mention having to wait another 35 minutes at the desk just to check out and get my parking sticker stamped so they would bring my car to me and the guys holding our luggage who acted as if it were a bother because I wasn’t really sure of a specific time we would be back to get it (roaming the city after checkout) Add to this the mobile check in iPads gone (missing from their stands) and smile camera in the lobby not working which was a fun perk. Want to top the cake? Try calling customer service ... they can’t help you with anything (literally) and act as operators and when you call the hotel you get either no answers or voicemails. NEVER again... the only plus was location but the stress and time loss wasn’t worth it! So disappointing to say the least.. ",12/24/18,2
German on front reception went above and beyond for us to make our stay as comfortable and as enjoyable as possible. Great location in NYC defiantly will return in the coming years. Comfortable beds helpful and friendly staff,12/23/18,4
I stayed here for 5 nights me and my partner both had our drinks spiked whilst staying at the hotel. The first was a man in the lobby who put a tablet in my partners pint the guy run out of the hotel when my partner confronted him the security did nothing but did call fake police as my partner was angry. The second was last night I was sat Alone having a drink I felt awful went to my room rang my partner to come home He was refused entry into the hotel again fake police arrived and bullied my partner they would not let him attend to me I was at this point laid paralysed for hours. We were then asked to leave the hotel early this morning as we were in the wrong according to the hotel manager Steve We were the innocent party spiked twice in there hotel because we tried to report it and we caught them out they did not like itThey have some dodgy scam going on to spike and rob there guest,12/23/18,1
"The ROW is always at the top of our list, the staff is courteous and they do try and accommodate any request. Having restaurants and places to eat in the hotel is great .It is our 7 th time New York the 6th time at the Row  ",12/23/18,5
"Shout out to Junior at the front desk. My husband and I visiting NY for a short trip. Unfortunately we arrived late and the front desk was backed up checking in folks in a long line. We were exhausted and just wanted to get our rooms...... BUTTT never imagined customer service to completely turn around our mood. Junior was pleasant, accommodating and HOOKED it up, offered recommendations to dining areas so we were extremely happy. Give this guy a raise.... but keep him customer facing, he REPRESENTS your brand and represents it well!! Hotel is great, a nice live DJ, a bar, restaurant, heart of Times Square. Thanks Row, we will def visit again! Pic of drink to show the bar hooks it up too lol ",12/22/18,5
"I booked the ROW for a couple nights to see a show and spend a day checking out Time Square and Rockefeller Center. The hotel is in a great location, close to everything. I had booked a package that included valet parking, so despite having to make sure I packed exactly what I needed, it was very nice not to have to worry about the car, and the rate was cheaper than some of the other hotels. Based on the hotel site's pictures, I knew the rooms were going to be small, and I was worried that my wife and I were going to be stepping on each other. Well, the rooms are small, but better than I expected. Space for bags is very limited, but a well place ironing board helped that out, and was also a handy table. The bed was comfortable, and the city view looked out on the corner of 44th and 8th ave - not bad.The strangest thing about the room was the tub. I don't know whether it was a messed up replacement tub installation or if it was designed that way, but the bottom of the tub was like it was jelly underneath. I'm sure it might be comfortable for taking a bath, but trying to stand still to take a shower was not only challenging but a little dangerous. There are frequent crowds at the elevators. They have a unique elevator system where you punch in your floor on the panel where you would normally press up or down, and the system tells you which of the 12 small elevators to get into. The pile-ups happen as new guests arrive and try to get on arriving elevators only to find out there are no floor buttons inside. A little information at check-in woudl allebviate this problem. Overall, it was not my favorite hotel, but based on price, I would consider it again for a short stay. ",12/22/18,3
"I enjoyed my 4 night stay at Row NYC! Junior at the front desk was absolutely amazing, delightful and made me feel instantly welcome. Delcy, who was my room attendant on the 27th floor, greeted me daily with smiles and laughter and happy talk! She made me feel at home here. Because of these two outstanding individuals, Junior and Delcy, I will return to the Row NYC. Their customer service and people skills exceed above and beyond the norm. Row is lucky to,have these two individuals. Thanks Delcy and Junior! I’ll be back! Patrick Driscol ",12/22/18,5
"We’ve just got back from 5 days here. I have nothing bad to say at all. We emailed requesting a city view, and got a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room with a city view! We didn’t have to queue at check in, longest we waited for the elevators was 5 mins. The hotel is a perfect location, 1 minute away from Times Square, surrounded by everything you could need! Room was spotless with an amazing view. The only thing I can say is do not buy from the shop in the hotel! $12 for 2 bottles of coke ",12/22/18,5
"Interesting hotel..you wonder why there are so many people about...? Reception staff probably were recruited from a correction centre. Check in was a nightmare, promised to confirm room availability by email, which they never did, then after me emailing hotel they informed me my room was ready. So I went back and stood inline, hmm 12 deep to wait to collect my key. What is astonishing is that when I first arrived at 9am they couldn’t wait to get my credit card details but I still had to stand in line. It’s like a ymca camp. You can’t just go to reception with a complaint because there are only two people there with a mile deep of people waiting either to check in or check out, and that doesn’t matter what time you try to attempt it, although I have been down ther with no line of people but there are no staff there! It sort of reminds me of faulty towers.......don’t employ anybody and we will save money. So I have just rung downstairs to ask why my room hasn’t been serviced and yes you got it, no one will answer the phone, because the only two people who work here are trying to check people in and check people out. I am a gasp at the running of this place, never come across anything like it. Oh and just so you know, even if you have independent wifi, and you are not a GYM junkie you will still pay for everybody else’s use of these facilities at US$ 36 per day and that is not an option!! My room is quite ok, only because I paid more to upgrade, certainly not what online presented. Do you know my big problem....don’t take me as some sort of fool, because I’m not and you are treating me as such.I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, they provide rooms in a fashion of back packers and charge full tote odds and the horrendous thing is they get away with it. Recommendation, when you are googling places to stay in New York don’t get sucked in, there are plenty of other really gorgeous places that will actually treat you like a customer and not an inmate.Hmm have I cooked my goose.....I don’t check out for two days...can you imagine the bill after this little critique .... Karenne Roennfeld ",12/21/18,1
"never again you get what you pay for, had issues throughout our stay, it was my wifes and mine anniversary. first with the check in. not even a welcome or even how are you, next we are told we will get an email about our room being ready shortly nothing came. ",12/21/18,2
"Zac was absolutely amazing when we arrived after a long flight from England. Very accommodating and polite! The beds are so comfy and room is nice! Definitely recommend! It is in a great location within walking distance of broadway, times square and many attractions ",12/21/18,5
Rooms were clean but small but your not in your room that long so no big deal. Bed was comfortable but not the pillows. Great location. Good price considering it was close to Christmas. Housekeeping was great. Some of the staff at check in and the bar/restaurant could have had a better attitude,12/21/18,3
"There is black material encircling each of the silver discs in the bathtub/shower space.. My plumber recently advised me on how to remove such material: Just scrape it off, or use an extra-strong abrasive cleanser to remove it. These black areas harbor micro-organisms. Just has been the case over my many years of coming here (consecutive Decembers and other months), the situation re the lack of safety bars in the bath tubs continues. There is none. What if someone falls when rising from the tub? Absolutely NO protection in any room that I've occupied over the years! Clearly, the computers need to be re-evaluated and fixed at least daily. As I write this, more than one computer is malfunctioning ",12/21/18,3
I enjoyed my stay at The Row - it’s in a great location and has many local restaurants to choose from. Trains are in walking condition. The theatre is near the hotel. Also many shopping areas nearby. I felt very safe inside the hotel and everyone was polit,12/20/18,5
Would give higher rating if we didn’t have to climb 14 flights of stairs to get to our room since elevators were Always full. I recommend staying on the lower floors because anyone over 13 flight will need to wait a long time for an elevator.,12/20/18,3
"We are currently on our honeymoon here and we are very disappointed to say the least! My husband emailed the hotel a few weeks before our arrival to say it was our honeymoon they got back to us and says they would do everything they could to make it special!! We were excited after getting this reply, well upon arrival late at night we were greeted with a rude receptionist we didn’t get as much as a congratulations from her, She then demanded money $300 dollars to be exact $200 of this is a facilities fee which is a disgrace none of us are interested in the gym or business centre! Just the WiFi and safe, we paid it anyway. Then the further $100 will be returned if we make no damage to the room during our stay! I mean seriously?!! I said to my husband there may be a nice surprise when we get to the room! No there was not, just this small dirty room! There’s a burn mark on the dresser, the drawer next to the bed doesn’t close fully unless forced many times and the mattress springs are broken! So far I’m wondering what on earth we paid over £2,000 to stay here!! The nicest part of the room is the view to the city. In our corridor there is a constant smell of weed that seeps under the door and we can smell in our room! Totally disgusting! Yes it’s legal in the state but is it to be smoking in a hotel room? I think that’s dangerous and toxic! Moral of the story if it’s your honeymoon do not book this has been a total waste of our time and we’re already looking at booking a beach honeymoon in a few months elsewhere! Cannot even explain how angry and disappointed we are ",12/20/18,1
"The room was clean and had a great view, but we waited almost an hour in line just to check into our room. There is also no quiet way to open and close room doors. Guests and room service repeatedly slammed the heavy metal doors from 1am all the way up to 11am throughout the early morning. I'm a heavy sleeper from Dallas, Tx. None of the sirens and honking kept me up just the noisy people around me ",12/20/18,4
"First time to New York City and this hotel made it part of the special experience. Friendly and professional staff, clean room with a corner view of Times Square, and a great location which allowed us to hit the pavement each morning and check out a different direction for the day. ",12/20/18,5
Everything was really great and we were treated very well. We requested early check in and we got it! We were treated with the upmost respect by everyone on the staff. Also the hotel was a great location,12/20/18,5
"Decent rooms with a good location to Times Square. Bed was a little hard, but what hotel isn’t? Good food though in city kitchen that’s attached to the hotel! Cleaning staff was amazing, and kept you taken care of. ",12/19/18,3
"My wife and I stayed recently (Dec 7-9, 2018) and everything was as good as the first time. We were in town for the Central Park Half Marathon and took the opportunity to do some Christmas shopping, see the Rockettes at Radio City, saw Kinky Boots on Broadway. The hotel location was perfect and allowed us to walk to everything. The breakfast choices on site were delicious and the bar was ideal for nightcaps. If you are heading to broadway this is the place to stay for convenience and access to some great restaurant choice around Times Square ",12/19/18,5
"My husband came home from a 9 month deployment and we celebrated with a trip to Manhattan. This was actually my second time staying at The Row, but his first time. We loved it! The room IS small, but it's New York City. All we needed was a bed and shower and we're out exploring the city and seeing shows most of the day and evening. The location is within a block or two to Times Square, restaurants, delis, and the theatre district as well as the subway. Easy for Uber to find us too! Definitely worth it, would recommend ",12/19/18,5
"Arrived with a group of 12, 6 rooms booked back in July. Upon check in, each couple received different info re: rooms, room upgrades, etc. 2 Couples got free comedy club tix, 1 couple got a King upgrade for same price as the rest of group who were told we could ONLY get 2 double bed type rooms, & 1 couple were charged $200 more than the rest of the group. When asked, rude staff advised ""your friends are lucky we could charge them more too"" UNACCEPTABLE! Elevator banks are terrible, long wait time...rooms are FILTHY. Seems they don't vacuum, scummy sink wouldn't drain. Bathrooms have a sliding barn type door with gaps and no exhaust fan. Terrible situation! Had to beg for washcloths daily, maids barge into rooms without knocking, beds are literally a mattress on a box, super low to the ground, while comfortable, still low. The supposed complimentary continental breakfast was charged to our rooms on several occassions & a pain trying to get removed by the rude staff. I don't recommend anyone staying here. ",12/19/18,1
"Over all good hotels, old building but renovated, noisy as everywhere in Manhatten. Due to its size very crowdy. Locatied near to Time square and subway enables easy travel around Manhatten. Rooms are small but comfortable. ",12/18/18,4
"Stay at the ROW NYC for convenience, affordability and friendliness. The location was ideal for the Theater, walking to sites and overall as a starting point for the city visiting It is also close to Restaurant Row, the best selections in food and hospitality! ",12/18/18,5
This was a lovely hotel and in a perfect location just a street away from Times Square. My partner and I caught the train from JFK into Port Authority station which was very easy and cheaper than taco or Uber. Hotel was clean and staff very helpful. I didn’t spend much time in the hotel itself however the rooms are VERY VERY small. The bathroom is very cramped. The facilities in the room were good with good wardrobe space and a huge bed! If you are looking for a place to rest your head after a long day exploring this is perfect with its location. Bar is nice and not horribly priced. Baggage hold was a bit of a disaster with so many people leaving at one time and not enough staff but still very friendly hotel,12/18/18,3
Great View! Great Staff! Great Service! Huge hotel with smooth service. This is an incredible formula. I definitely recommend to any tourist....very strategic location! Close to everything and easy to move around,12/18/18,5
"My overall rating was poor because the hotel provided a lack of value for the cost. Daily rate was high for such a small room. But lack of service and amenities really pushed my rating the other way. There were many issues during our 3 night stay. Understanding that they are a very busy hotel with many rooms during the holiday season, nonetheless, they seem grossly understaffed. They need a dedicated service line or team to deal with guests. The front desk was constantly busy with incoming and outgoing check in-out, and would have no time to deal with service enquiries. I phoned at various times over the 4 days only to reach no one (the phone kept ringing). Also, cleaning/housekeeping was very poor. On Friday (Dec 14th) we can came back to our room at 5 pm (after leaving for the days events at 10 am) only to find the room was not tended to at all (bed not made, no replacement of towels, etc). After complaining to manager, then service was provided Friday night. Much to our surprise, essentially the same problem came Saturday again when we returned to our room late afternoon.We also had an issue with black water coming from the bathtub faucet which seemed to be resolved shortly after we reported it. They should also provide extra blankets and pillows to the client rooms, which turned out to be necessary given the central air/heat nature of your HVAC The manager (Steven) promised us a full rebate on our amenities fee (approx $125 for 4 days) and we only received $30. Nice enough gentleman, but in my opinion he should have followed through to see that our issues were handled to our satisfaction.I would not recommend this hotel to my friends or famil ",12/18/18,2
"We were checked in by Junior & he was very helpful. We donated to their charity and got the chance to 'spin the wheel' for prizes. We got an upgrade, free drink & tourism tax cancelled between our 2 couples. Hotel is next to Times Square and Broadway, very convenient. Rooms are basic, no kettle but 24 hour places around but it's a great place in regards to helpful staff & convenience. Room has iron & hairdryer but really missed a kettl ",12/18/18,4
"A charming, comfortable hotel well-located for a weekend in NYC. Staff were welcoming and helpful. The rooms, though small, were very clean and well-appointed - and the beds were particularly soft and comfortable. Looking forward to my next stay at the Row ",12/17/18,5
"We stayed at ROW NYC for 4 nights and I have to be honest, having read some terrible reviews prior to our visit i was a little worried it would be small/dirty/loud. Well we arrived on a thursday so I think that was slightly more quiet, but we waited a short time to check in. The staff were all friendly, helpful, warm and clearly very busy!! We then went upto our room which was much bigger than expected given the reviews, with a decent view for a city, VERY comfy bed, clean, tidy and with toiletries! I appreciate it was a bit worn around the edges but no more than anywhere else of that size/age and with such capacity. I do think people have been very fussy on here review wise without consideration for the sheer volume of guests/rooms and location! Our shower was always hot and we both showered twice a day, the bed was made daily with clean towels and the facilities didnt fault us at all. ROW NYC is located perfectly for everything!! We asked almost daily where to go/best places/how to get there etc and were always given good advice which was helpful. Lots of people have complained about the lift system, again, there are hundera of rooms at this hotel and it really isnt anyones fault if you have to wait longer than others. It can be frustrating, yes, but it really isnt the end of the world in the grand scheme of things! We would definately come back to ROW NYC and were more than satisfied with our stay. Thankyou to all of the staff from reception, bar, maids, luggage attendants and all the others behind the scenes who im sure we didnt get a chance to set eyes on!!! Nick & Poll ",12/17/18,4
"The hotel is conveniently located to Times Square and the Port Authority. It's an average hotel for the price. The room was extremely small. Overall it was fine, but nothing that is going to give you a wow factor ",12/17/18,3
530 dollars per night even for peak seson is outrageous given the quality of the room and service. I would've expected a room with at least a bottle of water for the guests. Other hotels at lower prices offer mini-bar and coffee brewer for the morning. The room was absolutely essential. The toilet clogged and nobody apparently cared to take care of it. I had to call 3 times and finally only after I complained at midnight someone came to solve the problem,12/17/18,1
"Would only stay in again if I only cared about close proximity to Times Square. Room was dirty and not worth the price. Felt secure. No coffee pot or refrigerator in room, and water from dispenser came out cloudy ",12/16/18,3
"I had a very disagreeable experience with security staff of the hotel that are really not prepared to deal with guests. They were very rude and unpolite, with excessive roughness, with completely no reason. ",12/16/18,3
Can’t beat the location. Rooms are small as all NY hotels they are clean beds comfortable and exactly what you need to explore this magnificent city.All the Bar staff are absolutely amazing they make your stay here so enjoyable I think I will always stay here because of them Reception staff Robert is one of the friendliest and most helpful human beings I have ever had the pleasure of meeting,12/16/18,4
My family and I are just home from holiday at ROW NYC and had a fantastic time. The hotel was in a perfect location to visit all the best sights in New York and the hotel itself was great. The room and bathroom were spacious and clean with maid service daily. The staff were helpful and welcoming especially Junior who checked us in. We would definitely stay again and would recommend it to our friends and family.,12/16/18,5
The rooms where more like a bac packers stay over room than a hotel room. Price was high for the quality of the room. Hot water took 10 minutes (Yes 10 minutes) to come through to tap. You are EXPECTED to pay $30 for facilities even if you don't want them. Very Poor,12/16/18,1
"Second time staying here, and we got an upgrade to a front view room. 11th floor, the higher the floor, better room. We didn't use any of the facilities outside the room, apart from WiFi which is good.I do think, however, the rooms are looking a little tatty, our bathroom was badly painted and we also had a cockroach in there! Would possibly stay somewhere else next trip. ",12/16/18,3
"Very convenient location (Broadway, MTA E train) with very good restaurants in house. My room with a view didn't have much of a view this stay; I had much better views during earlier stays. Room could have been cleaner, but I really didn't care. ",12/16/18,4
"Loved the location and the room was very nice - what more can you ask for in Midtown Manhattan? The elevator system kept things movie and everyone was very friendly and helpful - front desk, housekeeping, doorman, etc. ",12/16/18,5
"Rooms a little small, but made up for by the great service at all levels, from checking in with Zac to the cleaner in the hall to the great coffee at the breakfast bar. A shout out to the hotel staff, made a holiday trip a happy one ",12/16/18,4
After arriving late in the evening the staff were more than welcoming especially zac & Paola they helped us sort a couple of problems that we had with the reservation. The hotel is clean & smart and in a great location. We would definitely recommend roe nyc to family and friend,12/16/18,5
We wanted a bigger room and Cristina T. from reception arrenged it to us right away. Excellent customer service from her! Customers comfort is clearly a priority for her. Definitely going to enjoy our stay in Row NYC. Highly recommend,12/16/18,5
"Overall the experience was good. The location was great and price was rather reasonable. Zac was very helpful when we checked-in, so we were able to get to our room quickly. The breakfast cafe in the morning was very limited and the holiday decor was abysmal by comparison of the rest of the city, but I would stay here again. ",12/15/18,4
"Having visited New York once before and staying in an old-fashioned hotel, I thought I would go modern on this occasion. Don't let the photographs fool you, this hotel is average. Upon checking in, you get given your room keycard and room number - nothing else. You then have to figure out how to access the lifts to each floor, as not all the lifts go to each floor. The lifts are hit and miss - you could be waiting a while! The corridors are very dark and dingy and when you eventually arrive in your room, you aren't greeted by anything much more spectacular. We only had one keycard that worked to start with.The room was dated, it needed a complete facelift as there were bits of broken skirting board, scuffs and stains on fabrics and the carpet was filthy. I was expecting a bit of information in the room regarding the hotel, such as eateries, facilities, how to work the tv, etc. Nothing. The air conditioning would not go below 18.5C so restless nights were had. Of course we could've opened out brick-wall facing window, but then you are greeted with the noise of the bustling city below. Storage was severely lacking, we struggled to store only two suitcases and had to live out of them for the entire trip. The one positive about the room was the bed! Kingsize with a memory foam mattress topper - amazing. The City Kitchen is a welcome addition to the hotel, although it does close early on certain days and some of the vendors don't serve food right up until closing which can be misleading. Staff weren't overly friendly and didn't seem to enjoy their jobs within the lobby. Iconic M (gift store) is only small, however it does stock some necessities. The man in the store is lovely and jolly. Check out is from 12pm, although you can leave your luggage in storage until you need to leave. Again, this is not signposted and there is nobody to assist you with your cases. You get your invoice posted under your room door during the night before checkout of which we were shocked with the extra charges. The booking states that you have to pay the room tax, per night which we accepted, but then there is tax on top of that too. It would be more transparent if they included this at the beginning of the booking as you think you're getting a cheaper hotel, when in actual fact you're not. If you require the toilet facilities after checking out, you will have to visit the concierge desk as they require key access to use. The attempt to get a taxi from the doorman upon leaving was an effort, we were stood there waiting to be seen to and he didn't seem to want to assist us. When we were eventually acknowledge, we were not really greeted in a friendly manner. In the future, I would rather spend more money on a nicer hotel and have a better staff experience than go cheaper. Unfortunately, this hotel was not up to my standard and I don't believe their photographs and information on the website is an accurate representation of their hotel ",12/15/18,3
"I can’t reccomend the hotel. Room was very small and old. Was really untidy, were a lot of hairs, awful! Behind the bed never clean for sure. I asked about an upgrade room, but was impossible. So I checkout after one night ",12/15/18,1
"The location for this hotel was great, near Times Square and subway. The rooms were a decent size for NYC, but the electrical plugs in the rooms did not work and the elevators had typical NYC issues in the morning. Otherwise a great hotel ",12/15/18,4
Stayed here for 5 nights and could not fault the Hotel. Located in a great location very close to Times Square and loads of shops it really is the place to go. Room was cleaned daily with fresh towels and could not fault this hotel!,12/15/18,5
"I decided to switch it up and stay at a ""boutique"" hotel. This hotel was larger than I expected but was great. It reminded me of hotels I stay in when in Asia. Small rooms and good use of space. Staff was nice. I wish there was room service because I had to work and didn't have time to always go out. The location is convenient to the subway which is across the street, in the theater district, a couple of blocks from Copacabana and a long stroll to Rockefeller Center. It is a subway stop from Penn station.The restaurants in the area are just OK, and a little pricey so you have to walk a few blocks from Time Square to get decent food. If in the area and the price is right I would stay here again ",12/14/18,4
"Liked the location of the hotel, but not necessarily what I had hoped for in comparison to the price they charge. Some pluses - some minuses - liked the availability of food 24/7 at reasonable prices -not bad but not outstanding ",12/14/18,3
"Upgraded our room for free, complimentary breakfast and drink, bubbly delivered to our room and fresh fruit basket the staff were very friendly and helpful, short walk to Times Square. Would definitely stay there agai ",12/14/18,5
"The hotel had perfect water pressure, and the hot water stayed through out the whole shower. The room was very cozy and comfortable. It was clean. The staff was impeccable. Front check in to check out it was a great experience ",12/14/18,5
I think the only reason I was surprised was because the pictures were so outdated and room was so small. Otherwise I wouldn’t have been so disappointed. The staff was very nice and helpful and location was prime,12/14/18,3
Was not too happy w/ this hotel stay this time. Price was High. Room was a sauna. Bed was low to the floor. Bathroom was small and gross. I was just not happy with my hotel choice at all. Especially for the price I pai,12/14/18,3
We were 3 friends staying at the hotel. We had a fantastic time. The staff were very helpful and Alexandra in sales excelled herself and was extremely helpful. The door men and the security men made us feel safe. The rooms were plenty spacious and the beds were very comfortable. The hotel was in a perfect location right off times square. We will defo be back. We could not recommend the hotel enough.,12/14/18,5
"Stayed in NYC for 4 days and had a slight blip at the beginning of our stay . Arriving at midnight should have been straight forward but the hotel had given our room away. The helpful staff member gave us multiple options of staying in a adapted room for one night until they could change our room. They waved our room tax for the inconvenience, which was very generous. anyway, the rooms are clean. Bathrooms are small and little dated.All mod cons but not kettle? Great view of over the front of 8th avenue. Wi-fi is not great and is not secure. The lobby is gorgeous but very dim even during the day. Tried the café/diner/bistro for breakfast one morning and it one health juice was $11!!. there are plenty of diners opposite for cheap or go round the corner to times square for slightly upmarket. Staff were all really nice but could do with an injection of light in the lobby ",12/14/18,3
"I've really enjoyed the location of the hotel and my room was great and clean. It's perfect to going around:time square, top of the rock, 5th ave, central Park. You have a lot of restaurants all around hell's kitche ",12/14/18,5
Recently stayed at The Row and it was very convenient to subway station and walkable to many popular sights. Loved have the market available to buy good right in the hotel lobby and plenty of choices. Thanks to Zac for giving us a great run down of everything when we checked in,12/14/18,5
"This was the fourth year staying at this hotel for me. It is a budget hotel for sure...but the most affordable place in this area. The rooms are small, but in NY how much time do you spend in your room? The elevator system works very efficiently. What I really love about this place is the location.... right out the door and a short distance to the corner for the subway to just about anywhere. Also there’s tons of places to eat nearby, including vegan and vegetarian options for me, plus my theater locations were literally right around the corner. I always recommend to people to bring earplugs for sleeping at any hotel in NYC. So I get a good night’s sleep because I don’t hear the sometimes frequent sirens. I’ve seen people complain the lobby/entrance area is too busy; well you’re in NY for pity’s sake. Everything is busy near Times Square, I stayed for nine days and likely will do so again. This trip I was given the handicap room. My only complaint ... there was a bit of mold at bottoms edge of shower, but that didn’t really bother me.I might suggest to management that they give all carpets a more thorough shampoo now and then ",12/13/18,4
This is the perfect price and location to see the sites and restaurants in Manhattan. Walking distance from lots of interesting places. Rooms were clean and staff helpful. Great access control to elevators. Fast check-in. I strongly recommend this hotel for ur future visit to NY,12/13/18,5
1st time to NYC! Amazing location! Basic but clean and very comfy bed! Junior was very welcoming on reception! Very secure as needed to show key to gain entry! Couldn’t have had a better location for all attractions,12/13/18,5
"First time in New York, breakfast is a continental which is fair enough, however staff confirmed you can’t have certain items from the selection they had on the counter. Oh you had to pay $10 for the yoghurt with granola. No black tea, no salt for the eggs. Go to the bar for a drink no brandy? That’s if you could muster a smile from the girl at the bar. Rooms very small even with an upgrade bathroom no room to swing a cat. Lobby toilets, you have to have a room pass to open them not much good when you have to check out at 12 and you have to leave the hotel much later. In fact I am bemused about everything in this hotel and I am very well travelled. In fact the Only good thing is the WiFi and free international calls, that’s if you get a line? Wouldn’t book again if it was FOC ",12/13/18,2
"Great friendly staff, Junior at check in was extremely helpful and welcoming, he deserves an award for the friendly service he provided which kicked off a great vacation. Great location too, just off Times Square and easy to get to the sites! ",12/13/18,5
"Amazing location close to all theaters, shopping, restaurants and sight seeing. Friendly staff. Fast food restaurants inside hotel very convenient. Small rooms but clean and comfortable bed. Although hotel was busy elevators were surprisingly fast ",12/13/18,4
"It is not the first time that I stay at Row as I think its location is very good, near many attractions and also the subway. Last time I had a very nice surprise to be welcomed by Junior at the front desk. He is a brazilian guy, very friendly and helped me to find, on the internet, a place that sell an specific medicine I could not find at any drugstore near the hotel. He was always ready to help and I thank him. I can reccomend the hotel Row ",12/12/18,4
"At this time of year it is extremely expensive to stay in Manhattan. My travel agent suggested the ROW. The location is excellent, very central and felt very safe. The M bar was good for a platter and drink after a long day of exploring. The staff were mixed. The men bit to “cool for school” and being an older female but still holding her own, they didn’t take any notice of me. There was a lovely young lady that was fabulous and each night really looked after me. The check in was good quick. There is a resort levy of about $35 per day for free WiFi, water bottle in the room and access to ice and water machine. The room was clean but small and for the cost ( compared to what you would get in Australia) basic. The power plugs beside the bed didn’t work and despite reporting this were not fixed. The first two nights I couldn’t turn the TV off completely and had to cover the screen with towel. They fixed it after that very quickly. Just expect that being NYC it’s very expensive for fairly basic accommodation but it’s a trade off. I would definitely stay here again. The staff were helpful and the location fabulous and all was clean and safe. ",12/12/18,4
Got checked in by Cristina.T and she was extremely welcoming. She provided efficient and lovely service with a smile. An asset to the company. Our rooms were lovely and clean and a great base for our trip. Will definitely be back again :,12/12/18,5
"Recently stayed at ROW NYC, conveniently located a block or so from Times Square and in heart of theater district. Attractive lobby and convenient a la cart eating options. Did not order the breakfast plan which seemed very expensive. But ordering a few individual items also very expensive. (For an amazing breakfast best to stay at the Marriot Marquis at Times Square if you can afford it.) Valet and check in service staff were very helpful and personable (Car arrived quickly and unmarred at check out time.) Lines moved quickly at check in. We were needlessly directed by cleaning staff to bring our bags to lower level to check-in before going to the main desk for pre-check-in; may have been a language / communication issue there. Wished we had 4 towels instead of 3 since we booked for 4 people. Took longer than we would have liked to get the extra towel and some conditioner. The teens were thrilled with the city view. The room was snug but the beds were comfortable. Reasonably clean room. A little mold in shower grouting. Note that Sugar Factory adjacent to lobby only serves candy and not meals. Overall, no regrets. ",12/12/18,3
"We have just spent a week at this hotel. It’s a fantastic location to get round New York. You maybe a little overwhelmed when you arrive, the foyer is very very busy. Our room was warm without being to stuffy, very comfy bed, great view and I never found it to noise, would have liked coffee and tea and kettle but apart from that couldn’t complain. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I came back to New Yor ",12/12/18,4
"Look elsewhere!!! This place is not worth it, my room was the smallest I’ve ever seen. It was dirty and I had to pay $700 of my hard earned dollars for absolutely nothing. Would never recommend it to anyone. Sheets were dirty, no coffee, water... absolutely NOTHING in the room at all for them to have the nerve to charge so much. Do yourself a favor and book another hotel ",12/12/18,1
"I had stayed there 14 years ago and was not prepared to do it again, but my wife was impressed by the refurbishment (the coloured walls!). We were upgraded to a corner room without charge, so that was good. Surprised there were no tea/coffee making or fridge. But it was warm (once they fixed the heater), the lifts (to 26th floor) were efficient, the bathroom small but adequate and it is extremely convenient. We would use it again ",12/12/18,4
"This was the second time I stayed here. The staff are friendly and helpful - the bar staff even remembered my drink from last year! The hotel is close to Times Square, Broadway and the Port Authority bus station so everything is close by. The room was clean and spacious ",12/12/18,5
The Row hotel I thought was average The room was small the bathroom was very very small but for a short visit it was durable but a great location right on time square but in saying that we took the hop on hop off bus New York is a place to see great sight seeing the people I found very helpful polite and courteous the amount of show that were on such a choic,12/11/18,3
"Perfect location! On check in we donated to their chosen charity and got a upgraded room with times square view, was certainly worth it. Informed the hotel I was celebrating a birthday and when we returned to our room they had left a card & 2 x drinks vouchers. Staff very friendly and lovely clean rooms. Couldnt fault it. Would deffo return. ",12/11/18,5
"Standard room - comfortable bed, good view of city, good location, and clean but quite small and nothing really luxurious about it. It is in the heart of Times Square so if you plan to be outside of your hotel room most of the day, it is totally fine. Also, gym is bigger than expected which was a nice plus ",12/11/18,3
"My daughter and I had only 5 nights to spend in NYC so I thought staying right in the middle of everything was really important. What I didn't know was that Junior, a Brazilian front office attendant would make our stay so much better, by being helpful, friendly and also funny, we arrived there tired but after our conversation while he checked us in we already felt so relaxed that we were ready to go explore the city! He took care of each little detail and that made all the difference!!! Now my home in NYC is the Row Hotel ",12/11/18,5
Brilliant location. Close to time square and broadway. Frozen the musical is just round the corner. Room was small but we weren’t in the room for long because we were busy sightseeing. No room service but there is an onsite food court. Clean and modern. Only downside we were woken up a few times by drunk people banging on doors. Maybe more security Is needed,12/11/18,4
Great spot. Great options within the Hotel. Be careful when booking. The rates they show you are not the rates you’ll pay. Final bill was $200 more that estimated price. I booked my reservation through The Row’s own website.,12/11/18,4
"I was in New York from DC for our office holiday party. I wish I had reserved tickets for a show as the location is so close to the theatre, and stores, food etc. The staff was excellent - courteous, helpful and polished ",12/11/18,4
Amazing stay. The location is great. Close to all the shops and broadway shows. The lobby has a very modern style. Room had a nice view of the streets of NYC. Will definitely recommend this hotel to everyone.,12/11/18,5
We arrived The Row Hotel exhausted and ready to settle to find our travel agent had made a mistake and booked us in on the wrong date. The lady on reception Christina T was efficient and despite being full subscribed settled us into the hotel as she could see how exhausted we both were. The hotel room is small but perfect for a trip to New York I cannot imagine many folk would wish to remain in their hotel room when your so close to Times Square. Location is amazing!! Would recommend,12/11/18,5
"I have stayed at this hotel many times over the last 20 years, but after this stay, I will never stay here again. The place was dirty, and poor maintenance is observed every where. The price paid for this stay is not worth dealing with the issues that I experienced. Some staff were very nice and professional, but there were a few that I would not want to interface with again. Food service was great and that is about all the good things I can say ",12/10/18,1
"the perfect hotel for a holiday at NYC, it has a great position very close to Time Square, the room was very confortable, the breakfast was very good, ice and fresh water were disponible free at the floor ",12/10/18,5
"Very friendly staff! Hotel associate douglas was the best, he was very friendly and ready to help! Hotel is next to times square and right around the corner are broadway theaters. + clean rooms with good air conditionin ",12/10/18,5
"Hotel is located in a great part of New York City. Close to Times Square, The Theatre District & about a 25 minute walk to Central Park & is easy walking distance to the Shopping District. Clean & comfortable with great service. There is a restaurant & bar plus a small convenience store all located within the hotel. If there is one criticism, it is that tea & coffee facilities are not available in room. I would book this hotel again ",12/9/18,5
"Fantastic central location. The staff were very friendly, Junior went over and above to make us all feel welcome for our first time in NYC.We were lucky to have a fantastic view of the city from our room ",12/9/18,5
"Such a warm and friendly greeting from Junior at reception. We travelled from the UK through the night and it was wonderful to have such a lovely welcome to the hotel. Great location, One street away from Time Square, amazing bakery just across the road too! Would def stay at this hotel again. C Kin ",12/9/18,4
"Hey Great location, great service of Row NYC indeed... Specially the staff is really good.. crestina.t is really helpfull on front desk..I always stay here whenever I visit next York.. really happening plac ",12/9/18,5
"Arrived late in the evening and the receptionist was ok I guess (except for his blocked nose that he tried to clear by excessive sniffing up). We were told our room number and floor it was situated. When we entered our room I was shocked! It certainly didn't look like any of the rooms on the Row NYC website, it was small, cramped and had a view of a wall.The air con was blasting out cool air which we swiftly turned off because the temperature was around 34 degrees Fahrenheit outside.The only plus side was it was clean and tidy, but it was basic to say the least.I will certainly visit New York again, but I'll find another hotel ",12/9/18,3
The room was $550 and it's wayyyy too small. It comes with only one queen and no bottled water. Very disappointed with the room. Looks like they spent all their money on the Lobby and have nothing left for the rooms.,12/9/18,1
Excellent location. Speedy and accurate elevators system. No wasted elevator's time Nice settings: back to the future hippie's era. Overall cleanliness OK. Recommended if you are not too demandingBreakfast included a plus,12/9/18,4
"I booked this hotel for my 50th & wasn’t disappointed 1 bit, fantastic location & the staff can’t do enough for you,I was upgraded to a deluxe room for my birthday so when we arrived karena came to the door with balloons & drink vouchers for me I wasn’t expecting anything like that but they do go the extra mile for they’re guests. I will definitely be back at this hotel ",12/9/18,5
"Along with a group, we were slated to stay here for our weekend stay. What a mess of a place. The staff members, mgt, area, were as inept as any I've eve encountered. The Proverbial, ""passing the buck"" is paramount here. The staff to perform check in and out, were much like bank tellers, at their stations, but not reviewing patrons. With some five stations, only three would see a patron. The room deor is a left over palate from Halloween, orange, white and black???? The size is perhaps 12 x 15. We paid to have our luggage cared for....@$6.50 per case....they were tossing them worse than the airline crews...The main entry way has serious signs of deterioration, simply look at the steps...they are chipped all over. the corner rooms are laid out on a zig-zag, not on a 90 degree angle???? Pass this one up!! ",12/9/18,2
"Stayed here as a family of 4 for my cousins 18th birthday present. The hotel is in an amazing location. Almost central of NY, subway station on the corner, and a few streets on from Times Square! Pre arrival I’d emailed the hotel letting them know it was a special occasion and my cousin would be 18 on the 2nd day of our stay. They responded promptly asking for her name and dates we were staying with them. I assumed this meant they would leave a little something in our room.. possibly a small token gift or even a happy birthday message.. but nothing appeared which was very disappointing. Check in/check out very fast no problems encountered. Resort fee was reasonable as WiFi was a good speed. Hotel lobby and other areas of hotel very clean and well maintained.We stayed in room 1857, which was on the 18th floor. For 4 people this room was incredibly small, constantly bumping into each other, our cases, and the beds. No place to put 2 of our cases and 2 of them were already on the rack provided, so there was even less floor space. Queen size beds (UK three quarter beds) are verging on too small for 2 average size adults.. so anyone taller/larger than average would find the beds far too small. Also, only three pillows were provided which is ridiculous bordering on stupidity. 2 people in one bed with 3 pillows?! Do the maths people. Yes we could of rang for another pillow, but we were arriving back to our room at 10:30/11pm showering then sleeping and leaving at 6am so it was the last thing on our list. The bathrooms are tiny!! Literally enough space to stand from the toilet, turn to the sink, or step in to the shower. We had to dry ourselves in the bedroom as there’s no way you can bend/lift a leg without banging in to the sink toilet or bath! The decor of the bathroom was a bit shabby. The area around the sink had multiple chips as well as the door, and the door handle was falling off on the inside. Overall the room was very clean, which is my number one priority with a room. Fresh towels and bedding changed daily. I would stay here again, only because of the amazing location and I know the rooms are clean.The worst part of this stay for me is not just limited to this hotel, it’s the whole of America. People expect a tip for doing nothing except their basic job duties. I will always tip good service or for a great meal. As soon as people realise they aren’t getting a tip they don’t care about you anymore and will become dismissive and off hand. If they do receive a tip they will tell you it’s not enough which is incredibly rude. The only problem we had with this at this hotel was when we put our bags in storage for the day as we’d checked out. The bag boy said as we left our bags ‘you can leave a tip if you want’ then when told we’d leave it once we’d collected our bags he said ‘I’d rather have it now’. If it was down to me I wouldn’t have left a tip when collecting the bags due to sheer cheek and rudeness! ",12/9/18,4
"This hotel was nicely situated near Times Square, but the wifi was horribly spotty. I was here on business and was working much of the time I was in the hotel. I had to use my own personal hotspot from my phone when I was working in the room. We're not even talking about needing to stream video - I was just mainly using email and working with google spreadsheets. The wifi could not even handle that ",12/8/18,3
"Staff was very nice. Room was clean and internet/tv was good. Terrible sound proofing so you hear all of your neighbors. Continental breakfast is not a good experience or selection. Be sure to check your credit card during and after you stay, screw up billing easily ",12/8/18,3
"Rooms were okay for price and location. However We were accused of smoking in our room and were locked out of our room after being out all day then charged an additional $350. We waited for two hours for security to come look at our room again, they never showed. My husband spoke to the the early morning mgr to explain what may have happened. He didn't care. There were also hairs in the bathroom so we purchased cleaning supplies to clean ourselves. Would never stay here again or recommend to anyone unless they were desperate. You can get a room there for ~$300 if you use Hotel Tonight app the same day. That's really about what it's worth ",12/8/18,2
"We were visiting NYC for a birthday and holiday trip. We chose the hotel because of its location and a recommendation from a friend. The photos of the rooms on the website looked bright, clean and spacious. The room was none of those things. Almost too small for just two people ",12/8/18,1
"The people, the check in process and the property are unexpectedly friendly and easy. As crowded as NYC is, this hotel makes it easy to check in and out and the employees are extremely helpful. Thank you Shantell ",12/8/18,5
Everything on your doorstep. Room a bit small and not much space for clothes and storage but a clean comfy place to sleep.A few false alarms went off but a tanoy system in room told us not to evacuate. This hotel is being used for homeless families but security checks ensure only residents gain access too the elevators,12/8/18,3
"Spent 4 nights here in a Queen full city view room, having read the review was quietly dreading our stay. However it was very good, no issues checking in or out. No long wait for the lift, nor any dreaded smell in the hallway. Yes the room was a tad dated and could do with a bit of TLC, and the surfaces were a bit grubby. But once I had popped out and got some wipes, it was fine. Staff are very friendly and the location is amazing, and really all you are doing is sleeping off long days in the City. What I didn’t realise this hotel has 1,300 rooms that’s a huge footfall so I can understand that the hotel does look a little tired. But the staff and location was brilliant and made up for the decor . Thanks for a great week. Top tips; Avoid Juniors it’s overpriced and tasteless, make the 15 min walk to Andrews coffee shop best breakfast all week !! If you take a yellow cab have google maps to hand, as our driver tried to take us in the wrong direction. Wasn’t until I showed him , did he relent and I made sure he knew I was monitoring the route. Finally go to Sean’s bar good beer, good food. ",12/7/18,4
Great location. Speedy checking and key drop for checkout. Junior the check in guy was very welcoming. Room v clean. Unable to get late checkout but guys in the baggage hold were so helpful and friendly. Hopefully be back soon A,12/7/18,5
"Great hotel. Beautiful view. Excellent place to know NY. Near everywhere. But, fast food is not enough. Travelers need a restaurant in Row Hotel class. I recommend widely to my friends, young and old. ",12/7/18,4
What a great location. Not my first time and certainly not the last time I will stay here. We walked everywhere. We did not use any services in the hotel except the City Kitchen. So convenient to grab a snack,12/7/18,5
"I didn't know what to expect when I booked this hotel after reading very mixed reviews about it. Having booked the Standard Room I wasn't expecting much, but what a pleasant surprise. The room was spacious and bright, and the front desk gentleman was super nice when he assigned us a corner room (I asked him if it would be possible to have a room with a window view and he gave us two windows! With great views of the buzzing Theater District!). Room service was fine: clean room and fresh towels everyday, as expected. The hotel has a modern, relaxed vibe and it is always busy. It offers a food market with great options. We tried a couple of them and the food was delicious. Its location is fantastic! If you like the buzz of NY, you will be right in the middle of it (There's a lot of traffic noise, but we didn't mind too much). We walked everywhere and it was very convenient and safe. Overall, we were really pleased with our 5 nights stay at the Row NYC and, with the service we received for the price we paid, we wouldn't hesitate to book with them again : ",12/7/18,4
"Amazing experience and a very good location to stay in New York. Modern hotel and staff very nice. Near to Times Square and Broadway, a lot off restaurants around and near to the subway.You can also do almost everything walk. Rochefeller center, central park... ",12/7/18,4
"This is the 4th year that my friends and I have stayed at Row in December. This is the first year that the hotel charged $50 for you to enter your room early, even though the room is available. I think this is a ridiculous added charge. We will rethink where we will stay next December ",12/6/18,3
"Row NYC is worse than many 2 stars motel I have seen during my travels. The official pictures are photoshopped, the rooms are old, the bathroom is disgusting and the hotel overall is so bad that I cannot understand how it can legally put 4 stars on the door. To understand how bad it can be, consider that it is in a building of 1920s never properly restored. On top of this, the noise from the street is very loud, also during the night. We have no words to explain how much disappointed we are about having been deceived so badly ",12/6/18,1
"Excellent location but staff assistance and attitude was terrible,we had a mix up in our rates and they were refusing to review our point or review queries around overcharging. Manager would not talk to us ",12/6/18,2
Wish there was coffee in the rooms. The rooms are small but ok. The bathrooms are very small but somewhat workable. I have stayed several times at this hotel. I like that it is so close to Times Square,12/6/18,4
"Checked in last night and experience was horrible the to check-in. Take in mind is 30° outside, 8pm with 2 kids(2 and 4 yrs of age) and we just came in the hotel! The guy at the reception starts to complain because of my kids, instead of looking for a solution for my family and being unpolight. I'm not going to continue because the manager was the same mood too! They wanted to charge more and more, were I booked said 36.99 in service fee, they instead charged 50 per night and then another fee because of my kids! Saying that were fully booked while on other booking sites they had over 17 room option to stay!!! At the other day I went to reception and talked to MARIEL. Wow I just wish the hotel had more employees like her, so kind and delivered the same simple message that the other 2 ""tried"" the night before. Is not what you say is HOW YOU SAY THING, AND HOW YOUR FACIAL EXPRESSION LOOK! Service is the main thing they should have beacause the cleaningness and the rooms aren't 100%.I should give a 1 star review but, Mariel made our stay better and the kindness changed all my perspective! Maybe I will come back still have 2 nights here let's see how it goes!! ",12/6/18,3
"This hotel is in a great location if you plan to hit Broadway / Time Square or if you are looking for the touristy NYC experience. Rooms are on the small side but for the price you can live with it. Don't spend too much time in your room, go out and explore. Booking over the phone can be a bit of a hassle. we were given one rate, called back 20 mins later to book, talked with the same person and he had no idea about what he had just told us. The rate was then $40 more expensive. He worked with us but when we checked in it was all wrong. The front desk staff and manager (Irish guy) helped us out and were very accomodating. ",12/6/18,3
"As the title says I absolutely love this hotel, this was our third time staying, front desk were so helpful, room was high up and spacious , cleaning was done every day as needed. Location is excellent and I will always recommend this hotel for anyone visiting the city  ",12/6/18,5
Love this hotel! Very beautiful. Rooms are nice and so comfortable. We slept like a baby after our first night. We had an incredible city view. The staff was excellent and quite friendly. We really enjoyed the bar at the hotel and the location can't be beat! We will be back!!,12/6/18,5
"Unfortunately this hotel was very disappointing overall, but the good news is - we spent very little time in the room. The service was poor, the rooms were fairly clean but extremely small and out of date. ",12/5/18,1
"Bad experience. Dirty, small and noisy. Management doesn’t really seems to be interested in training their staff. How can you have your housekeeper coming to your room every morning when you are in your room? No do not disturb sign provided. Housekeeping department is a failure. Rooms are terribly small and no facilities at all. What is the facilities charges for???? All these extra charges are unnecessary. It’s not a hotel but a motel. ",12/5/18,1
"This hotel is clean, the bed is good. People are friendly. So, all in all it is OK. I still am not used to prices in NYC. The hotel is a bit shabby, best days gone. Room is a bit small, though I took the luxe one with view on city. I haven't tried the food yet. However, the location is great. Taxi's a bit difficult to get, but Uber is around as well. So, all in all I find it average ",12/5/18,3
"Just returned home from the Row NYC today and had an absolutely amazing time. The hotel welcome was very good, we were impressed with the decor of the lobby and were checked in promptly and efficiently. The guy who checked us in picked up on the fact we were celebrating a birthday and upgraded our room to one on the 26th floor with a view - we were really grateful as the view was spectacular. The room itself I have to be honest was a little disappointing - it was a bit tired and grubby, don’t get me wrong it was still nice, it just needed a bit of tlc. The goods - it was compact but not too much so, nice bathroom, good view, comfy bed. The bads: The windows were a bit dirty, the ceiling was cracking around the loud heater which kept throwing clumps of dust down onto our bed. We also dropped one of our phones down the back of the bed and were horrified to see how much dust was back there! The bar was great and the staff faultless - everyone from the bar to the cleaners were very friendly. A very enjoyable stay and a hotel we would go back to. ",12/5/18,4
"We went for a weekend of holiday fun and Broadway shows. The good about this hotel: midtown location and City Kitchen. The bad: room was dirty, noisy from traffic outside, WiFi kept dropping out, bathroom door stuck open, and the hallways smelled like pot. The room was so bad it was comical. ",12/4/18,1
"We have just checked in to the wonderful Row NCY on our first ever trip to New York to celebrate our Honeymoon. Our check-in was an absolute delight and we couldn’t have asked for a better start to our trip. Our room on the 25th floor has a stunning view of the Hudson River & 8th Street. We are super excited to spend the next 2 weeks here exploring the city, with all main attractions within blocks of our hotel. Anyone looking for a perfectly located hotel with great staff, this is your hotel. Highly recommend ",12/4/18,5
"Check in was slow and not properly done. Key didn’t work when reached room, had to come down to reception again for replacement. Lift crowded and slow. Corridor to rooms narrow and dimly lit with retro motif but sure doesn’t seem to serve the purpose. More like a cheap dingy love hotel setup. Room door are not sound proof and over a day, footsteps and noise can be heard. Wow the carpets are just black and definitely looks filthy and not cleaned and maintained. Toilet narrow and simply Difficult to manuevre around. Noisy heating. Bed is ok, sheets seems clean. 4 days of stay here were the most discomforting I had for a Long time. Location is good, smacked in the NY main action, Times Square ",12/4/18,1
"Recommendation from Virgin travel, great location for our base. Room clean tidy and well equipped, size not great but that seems thenorm in New York, staff were helpful yet professional, additional facilities were good ",12/4/18,5
"No good expireince, the bed wrost, the hitting didn’t work, we changed of room and we have a terrible experience again, because the room was very hot.The water in the tube was dirty, we can not take a showe ",12/3/18,2
Fun time with friends. Hope to keep the tradition going for a long time. And a perfect location where it is located in the area close to everything and easy to walk to see things. Close to shopping and to restaurant row.,12/3/18,5
"Hotel was so disappointing. The room was sold as a room for three, it was not!! It was small - tiny even for New York... the room was dirty, the carpets were filthy. The bathroom was even worse... the bath/shower had not been cleaned. All around the bath was full of ring marks from the previous guests .. The room had an industrial air conditioning unit outside the window and the noise was awful. Busy hotel, great location. the staff were lovely. But I would not recommend it.. if you're used to a better class of hotel avoid! ",12/3/18,1
"The main part of the hotel (lobby and service ares) do not look as nice as hoped, but the room was up to date, clean and nice. The staff was friendly and helpful and the luggage staff on the bottom floor took very careful care of my daughters cello we left for 5 hours on the day we were departing. ",12/3/18,4
"We were visiting for a night and the hotel was conveniently located around major attractions and the staff were all friendly. Unfortunately an inconsiderate guest decided to smoke in the hallway and the smell permeated the whole floor. I don’t know if they caught them or not, but it caused my allergies to flare up as it circulated through everyone’s rooms during the night. The cleaning staff were as unhappy about it as everyone else was but they were friendly and we enjoyed chatting with them while waiting for the elevator as they prepared to clean and attempt to remove the smell from Smokey McA-holes night cig ",12/3/18,5
"The hotel is cheap, crowded, bad cleaning service, small room, tv sometimes has no signal, check in times is 4 clock !! Door keys ( cards) had to replace them everyday !! No refrigerator in the room ice machine in top floor, the only good thing is iron machine and pad in every room ",12/2/18,2
"Good luck trying to get a live agent on the phone. I spent an hour an a half trying to get someone so I could inform them I would be arriving later than expected. -The heater made an awful sizzelling noise any time it turned on. -The toilet made a loud squeal type sound when you flushed it-Sink didn't drain properly and the floor of the tub was awful..it looked fine but when you stepped on it, it moved all over and made popping sounds. -Bathroom door doesn't actually connect, just a sliding door. I believe it doesn't lock either.. So if you arent sharing a room with family or a significant other it could be uncomfortable. No plug by the bed...its 2018No TV guide of any sort.The first doorman we met was rude, Phone was all crackley, couldnt hear anything anyone said whenever they called. On their website checkout says noon, my flight was delayed so I called for a late check out, before I could even finish my sentence the woman cut me off and said no and said 12 was the latest. Then them or housekeeping called us twice between 1030 and 11:45 to ask If we were staying or leaving. If checkout is 12 why would you continue to harraas guests? Also there was about $200 in additional fees nobody bothered to warn me about, even when I called before hand to confirm. HOWEVER, the location was pretty great and their are a variety of food options in the hotel, costly but they are there. also a lounge. Check in was swift and there is a store across the street.UPDATE. These people have now taken me for almost 2 grand. They have charged me in full a second time for my reservation yesterday which ended last week. Then admitted it was their system error but I would have to wait potentially 12 days to see it? What am I supposed to do until then ? I was told a manager would email me and as of today I have gotten absolutely no response on the matter or any resolution. I have to be punished with unpaid bills because they messed up so royally. Save yourself the hassel and stay at a different hotel that will give you peace of mind. This place is a headache between the staff and the room issues. Its not worth the location convenience ",12/2/18,2
"Very disappointed to find out that this hotel, which is well situated for restaurants, theatres and Times Square, did not have tea or coffee making facilities in room. Also to be billed for services that we did not use or had no requirement of. $150 for a 5 night stay for use of Gym, Business Centre, Ice making machine and water. In general the décor is very dark and bedrooms could be doing with better soundproofing. Do not deposit your room key until minutes before departure as all toilets in reception area require it for entry. Baggage storage attendant and concierge were extremely helpful ",12/2/18,2
Be aware that the hotel „sells“ free internet and long distance calls and sport facilities and then charges you USD 35 per day for it (without telling you in advance). Rooms are dirty and you hear the streets pretty loudly - truly bad experience. In the area around ROW find other suitable places which treat guests fairly.,12/1/18,1
Just back from four nights at this hotelOn 27th floor . Perfect location for exploring the city we walked to most things very easily . Great views from our room . Staff friendly and no issues with lifts . Would return as it’s great location for a reasonable price . Some tips if traveling to New York for the first timeTake comfy shoes/ clothes - lots of walking involved Use the subway it’s the cheapest and quickest way to get around Buy a city pass / better value for money We ate breakfast at juniors every day a short walk from hotel and alsoThe mean fiddler - great Irish bar with nice food . Few blocks from hote,12/1/18,5
"Room 2317. Really nothing to complain about. We got our room upgraded for free when the check-in staff realised we wouldn't be comfortable in the size of the beds. This was a problem with a 3rd-party booking company and NOT the hotel. That was amazing and much appreciated. Good security at the elevator bank - we needed to show our room key almost every time. Room was very clean when we checked in and since we were only there three nights we just kept the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door. Cleaning staff were very friendly when we met them in the hall and asked if we needed anything. Lobby looks very hip, very now. I felt old in comparison.Bed very comfortable and room was quiet - we faced the interior courtyard - but the heating unit was a bit noisy. Room had been renovated and the workmanship, especially in the bathroom, was fairly shoddy. Typical, small, New York room, but the toilet was so close to the radiator, I had to sit ""side-saddle"". Good for a laugh, but thankfully only for a weekend. Excellent location and price. Would stay again ",11/30/18,4
"Nice location, super service of security’s and very nice place to stay if you go to New York on vacations. You need to try de lobster roll in the restaurant in the hotel very good food on there but need to serve more but very good the taste ",11/30/18,5
"The service is verry kind and all the employees are so polite. The location is really verry important for me and ROW NYC has one of the best in my opion. It is located near some restaurants, theaters, pharmacys and all sort of convenience. The room was very clean and the view is amazing. The shower is really hot and nice. ",11/30/18,5
"I have never understood why this hotel is underrated. It’s in the heart of the city, has good service, a great bar with live music many nights, a fantastic food court, a good gym, and a wide variety of well priced rooms and an efficient concierge service. Just spend a little extra to keep away from tiny rooms or ones by the elevators and you’ll be fine. It’s NYC, so don’t expect huge rooms unless your willing to spend a fortune. Otherwise, ROW is one of the best choices in town. And I have been to many hotels in the city ",11/28/18,5
Row Hotel is a very conveniently located Hotel nearby Times Square but not right in the middle of the action. The Price you pay is very reasonable and the facilities are good and clean. The only thing not that good is the brekfast service as there are not too many options.,11/28/18,5
"Booked in to a really friendly greeting and warm welcome. Room compact but clean, perfect for a central base. The area is great for access to everything that you want. Plenty of eating places around. My only niggle was the rude abrupt member of staff who we encountered on Thanksgiving in the bar area. We had just sat down with a cup of coffee bought at the bar with two suitcases as we were waiting for pick up, to be told very abruptly, that the bar is closed and we had to move. Now I'd just purchased two drinks and had sat down within the designated area, with luggage and a tired 71 year old mother to be rudely evicted. The staff member informed me that I needed to move NOW and would not be allowed to finish drinking my coffee before we moved. Why they chose to close the bar area at 12.30pm on a Thanksgiving Day just amazed me. What happened to holiday spirit???? ",11/28/18,5
"There were no facilities in the room for coffee or a fridge to cool things the bar staff were dismissive and unhelpful. The food in the city kitchen was of poor quality. The bath had not been cleaned properly for some time mould found around faucet which on filling the bath went into the bath water the toilet needed to be unblocked shortly after booking in. First night had access to four towels for 2 people, on having room cleaned 3 towels from then on. Rubbish not removed from room such as pizza box of coffee cups only rubbish removed from small bin access. Concerge were dismissive and unhelpful, presented as not wanting to be disturbed. ",11/28/18,2
"1. It was 19hour direct flight from Singapore to Newark. The bus ride from the airport took us about 40min. Traffic was light due to Thanksgiving Days.2. I’m allocate on the 24 floor with one king size beds. The front desk manager was very accommodating by changing our room with two queen size on the 18floor. Thanks You.3. The room was decent in size with full of modern amenities. Well decor & arrangements.4. The housekeeping supervisor was kind checking everything is good & do we need anything.5. So far, all the hotel staff (front desk, Security & Housekeeping), they were fantastic. Full of smile & ready to help.6. So far we enjoy our stay here & enjoy our time here ",11/28/18,4
This hotel is ideal for a short stay in New York. Ideally located near to Times Square and a short walk to local train station/bus station. Managed to check in an hour early and staff were pleasant and helpful. Security is great as you have to show your key to access the lifts after 6pm. Walls are thin so can hear a lot of noise and also noise from the street. Generally good hotel. Would stay again.,11/27/18,4
"Poor, don't waste your money or time. Stay elsewhere. The hotel staff is arrogant and rude. You can't get anyone to answer the phone. The heater/ airconditioner barely worked. Took 10 mins to get hot water. Etc. Etc. Etc ",11/27/18,2
"From my initial research on this hotel the website looked great, a few bad reviews but I thought.. they are probably just disgruntled people...I should of listened to the review. From the moment we arrived we knew we had been duped, the website does not reflect the hotel. The check in staff are among some of the rudest people I have ever encountered.The check in began with being asked my name, 3 times, then to spell it...I was asked are you sure that’s how you spell it? ID was then produced, I was told that I should of spelt it right...off to a flying start. She told us we had views of broadway! I was very happy with this. We reach the room (**disclaimer I have traveled Asia, so I know what a small room is) it smelt like a musty old shoe, it was cramped, it had a king single bed with two small pillows on it to create the illusion of space..my view of broadway...all 6 cms of it I could see..we actually over looked trash filled gutters and a slither of broadway. Back down to reception we go, when we got down there , there was a seperate line and que for disgruntled guests..and boy there were lots. After a lengthy discussion with another dissatisfied employee, we were told that we could be upgraded at $30usd a night to a room with a queen bed on the 18th floor.We got to the room, it was bigger, in need of urgent repairs, mould filled bathroom and a queen bed, with their signature tiny pillows to create the illusion of a bigger bed. The room has two lots of windows one above the bed and to the side...if your not into noise this isn’t the room for you. We also had a thin door into someone else’s room (adjoining room) which we were not told would be a condition of the upgrade. At 10.30pm it was so loud I our room we called reception, was out on hold one, rang out on the second time, put on hold on the third, hung up on the fourth and the fifth time finally got through to the manager was 11.06 by now who informed us he had finished for the night... so down to reception we went. The next day we were upgraded to a room (thanks to Paola) on the third floor , over looking roxys diner.The hotel is not value for money, the website is a misrepresentation of the hotel and the staff.The staff are rude , arrogant, chew gum, tap their nails, roll their eyes at you and all kiss and hug hello on a shift?! Wtf! The baggage area avoid, you will be asked for money before you even tell them what you are there for.The pros- the location, the food court.....2 stars, one for location and the other for the food options ",11/27/18,1
"I have had other experiences in NY and I find this the best. the size of the room is excellent (considering the standard of the cubicles that exist in NY), my room overlooked the river and I could see the streets around. the location is absolutely prime. the luggage storage service is fantastic, especially in my case I arrived in town at unconventional hours and was able to enjoy both check in and check out and this was something that made all the difference in my trip. the hotel bar is very good. the internet is of excellent quality. the support for the guests is wonderful. I was absolutely happy with everything at the hotel. the staff are willing and polite. I've stayed in other good hotels but this one really stands out from the crowd ",11/26/18,5
Localização do hotel é o ponto fortíssimo! a cama é muito agradável  o recepcionista Marcelo foi muito atencioso e nos deu muitas dicas valiosas. gostei e recomendo! Location is the strong point! The bed is very nice  Guest service amazing - receptionist Marcelo was very attentive and gave us many valuable informations. I liked it and recommend it,11/26/18,4
"This hotel was in a great location and the prices wasn't bad for the location. However the room was extremely dirty and the heater was loud when it cranked on, keeping us awake at night. The staff was very prompt with checking the heater, but problem could not be solved. It wasn't worth the money we spent. Hopefully all the rooms are not like this ",11/26/18,2
"Cancelled room last minute via email on our day of travel to nyc. no other form of contact, when speaking to staff they weren’t helpful in the slightest. They requested us to call back in an hour. As this was a matter of urgency it forced us to pay over the odds else where!! ",11/26/18,1
"Excellent location and staff. No better place to stay than the Row! Fast service, fast check out, baggage storage if you get early, nice views from the room, water free, internet, cable tv, tub, clean room and bathrooms ",11/26/18,5
"Hotel was nice, very very well located. I walked to rockefeller center and to empire state building. Rooms were a little small but perfect for a couple. Service lady was very helpfull and all the staff were kind. They also speak spanish , so it was perfect for me  ",11/26/18,4
"You pay for a four stars hotel, but get only a two stars service. Tiny rooms not cleaned properly, very noisy heating/air conditioning which does not let you sleep at night. The only good thing is the central locatio ",11/25/18,1
"Spent nine nights at Row NYC in November 2018 and can't really complain about anything. Everybody who worked there was very pleasant and helpful, the room we were in was spacious, comfortable and very clean, and the value for money was terrific. We were very keen on somewhere close to Broadway/the theatre district, and found Row NYC to be in the best spot possible - just a quick walk to anywhere, really, including the subway if we wanted to go any further ",11/25/18,5
"front desk friendly and kind, room service very compromise liked the pillows and the view wow the view was amazing, security very efficient, location good, the City Market was very good the price was too high but whatever the taste was good specialy with the doughnuts aaaaaand with the clam chowder and 1/2 lobster tail and pork bun...tasty ",11/25/18,5
"Stayed here at the ROW ideal location, nice warm rooms. Staff very helpful and approachable. Didn't get chance to eat here, area always busy. I would defefinatly recommend and stay in this hotel again ",11/25/18,5
"Terrible experience at this hotel. staff were very rude and unhelpfulrooms were very small, we had to down grade our room as there was an issue with the one we were in all we was offered as compensation were drinks vouchers for the bar however were unable to use those as the bar was closed due to an unforeseen circumstances, however the unforeseen circumstance was that they were training a new staff member which doesn't make sense to completely close the bar area. Would not recommend this hotel, ruined our stay in New York ",11/23/18,1
It was just a horrible experience. Room was extremely tiny. Did not change sheets daily. Requested for more towels as it did not accommodate for 4 guests. Towels were brought to us at 2am when we were all asleep.,11/22/18,1
"Some upgrading of rooms is in need. The first room allocated to me was small, dingy and needed the plumbing fixed. There are lots of food facilities on site, which is very handy and The Sugar Factory attached makes excellent hot chocolate ",11/22/18,5
"If you want a hotel that is constantly busy, is overcrowded, and is in a very busy part of NYC this is the place to stay. If you want a clean, yet very very small room with 2 double beds that you have to step over your suit case (and other bed) to get to your bed, then this is it. This may be your thing, but it wasn't mine. On our recent USA trip, this was the one hotel (out of 6) that I was really looking forward to and unfortunately it did not live up to its impressive website. We considered moving hotels, however this would have added extra expense and been too difficult to get refund etc.. For the price, we were disappointed.The food was very expensive in the bar, and I really didn't find the hotel staff to do anything more than what they really needed to, particularity at reception. One final note, was the elevator lifts (cars) going up to our room were temperamental at the best of times, we found ourselves stuck with a guest helping us out. When it was reported to reception staff, they weren't too fussed although did act on it. Finally, on a positive note the door man was fantastic and very helpful, as was the guy doing the luggage storage and I was very impressed how he spoke fluently in another language to a guest who did not speak English, all while his helper argued with him! He handled it very professionally ",11/21/18,2
"The hotel lobby and staff were absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately in our king room the beds were pushed together to make a king. It really made for a horrible sleeping experience and one side was completely unusable since it was 4 inches lower and sloped towards the ground. In addition, the shower curtain was filthy and the tub drain was clogged ",11/21/18,3
"The hotel has a great location if you want to be in hustle and bustle of the city. However, if you want a more relaxed or romantic atmosphere choose another hotel. The rooms are small (but clean). Security is located at the elevators, that can be helpful with all the people in and out of the building. I'd be more likely to stay again if they didn't have ""resort"" fees ",11/21/18,3
"Junk food in the hotel, No room service, Noisy from the traffic, the hotel is situated near broadway, it is all rignt for holidays...if you Don't like sleeping...The shop of the hotel is very small, 20 dollars for a made in china umbrella, the price was not indicated ",11/20/18,3
"We arrived in New York knowing we were too early for check in. Our plan was to drop off our bags before exploring the city. Before even being assisted hotel staff requested a tip simply to place our bags in a storage room. We brought the bags to the room ourself. Reception staff promised to send us an email to inform us of the possibility of checking in before the mandatory 4pm. Out of exhaustion we got back to the hotel at 2pm, luckily our room was available but no email was ever sent. Our room had foot prints on the walls and hand prints on the ceiling, no idea how they got there. And to round off a terrible day, a call was made to request a kettle. A second call was made an hour later to follow up. It is now over 2 hours as I type this. Still no kettle. ",11/20/18,1
Great location. Cleaning lady did a great job.So nice and friendly.So loud can hear the street and neighbors. Bring ear plugs.35$ to rent fridge but don't know where they would put it. Great place for a weekend but not a week,11/20/18,3
Location is great & the staff are helpful. We thought we were getting a room with a view & when we walked in we had a view of a brick wall. Called the front desk & was told to come back to see what could be done. They tried to explain the difference in the rooms which seemed complicated but they did move us to another room. The view wasn't great but it was better than it was. Other than this we love the Row. It's the only place we stay when going to the city,11/20/18,4
The personal was really friendly. BUT the room was really really dirty. The Bathroom was much more dirty. A big cockroach tapped my feet. The location was perfect. Value for money is not right for me,11/20/18,3
"I recently stayed at the Row and was pleasantly surprised after reading all the reviews. Check in was done by a young lady named Rhea who greeted me with a smile and gave me a wonderful room on the 14th floor. The room was clean in and out. Now I can complain to complain but there wasn’t anything to complain about. Bed was comfy, sheets were clean,pillows were fluffy, Towels were clean. Loved my stay and would come back.I wonder if maybe a little patience might help when writing reviews. When the Hotel is full and it was expect the phone to be busy or not answered then go down to the front desk, someone is always there. I am confused about the people who write that the elevators are a lengthy wait. You push in your floor and it takes you to your floor. If not they fit no more than maybe 6 people and might stop at a floor or two but you get there much quicker then a regular elevator.The location is what you want when going to New York. Where else can you do a show,steakhouse,jazz and comedy and walk to each location. Thank you Row I’ll be back ",11/20/18,5
"Great Hotel at few minutes to Times Square. Nice room, kind staff, no rumours, good wifi, good cleanliness, comfortable queen size bed. Comfortable spaces, available fresh water for all Guests. Hoping to come back there as soon as possible ",11/20/18,5
"I called several times throughout the day durring my stay, no one answered the phone. The bathrooms could've cleaned better. The check in was great the staff was friendly, pleasant. Great location. 1 block away from time squar ",11/20/18,3
My stay was pretty good. The hotel is a very good price and has good food options in city kitchen. some cons unfortunately were that the rooms were not that clean but if you ask for them to be cleaned again service comes quick. Toilets need to be remodeled they are very old and some things in the room are old. But this was overall a good stay.,11/19/18,3
"The hotel location is great! Walking distance of 3-5mins to Times Square. On 18/11 (Sunday), I called the guest service n spoken ard 7.30pm for a new hair dryer telling him that the one in my room was not working. He confirm with me my room no but was not delivered. I tried calling at 8.15pm again n he transfer my call to Housekeeping. No one answered. My subsequent calls from 8-9pm was never answered n auto call off after ringing n to voice mail service. Even using the house call outside the lift to call operator for 5x also no answer. I went to reception ard 9pm telling a lady staff my problem that the telephone call was not answered n I need a new hair dryer urgently. She gave me a dirty look n show no empathy even I told her that I been trying to call n no one answered the call for the past 1+hr! Asked for comment form n she just said no we don’t have any! Spoke to the female duty manager in charge ard 9pm but sadly no hair dryer was sent n I have to call again at 10pm! The call was transfer to housekeeping n finally delivered ard 1025pm! Finally the male staff house keeping came with new hair dryer. He told me the hair dryer was above the closet! I told him is not working n he went testing at 2-3 socket n walked off with the damaged hair dryer. Be prepared that u can’t get any help if u need one. To row NYC, pls consider change your wording press 0 emergency! Cos emergency line should not be operated this way! ",11/19/18,2
"This time i stayed in room 2034. As we know it before, i stayed many times. There is no change, still chaotic crowded, there is a huge queue in front of the elevators. Workers are trying to be kind enough. If your expectations are’nt so high, still good for just staying. There is no point in excepting more than staying. But as you know, if you book a room, it is considerable that your room was cleaned before you come in. Although i never used that towel that can be seen easily, i was surprised how dirty a towel can be! Needs more attention and more cleaning. By the way, air conditioner works like a diesel engine. Thanks for reading the comment ",11/19/18,2
"This hotel is in the best location in NYC. Everything was very efficient and easy, especially check in.The rooms were fabulous, wifi super fast, staff lovely and the food options were superb.The food in city kitchen cannot be beaten. I would stay here again and again ",11/18/18,5
"Hotel is at a convenient location. But staying somewhere for extra 20 to 40 $ a night will pay for it self.I stayed 6 nights. The overall service was horrible. My room was showing signs of decay. The only good thing was the BAR downstairs in the lobby. The towels in my room where not changed few times- the old ones where just folded back/ one still damp/. Had to ask for towels all together one day. A cleaning lady one evening showed up at my room at about 11 pm trying to force her self in, telling me that the manager asked her to clean that room. After calling somewhere she did not even apologize - just said it was a mistake. The bell boy literarily asked me for tip — I understand how america works and always takle care of the staff but to have someone tell me well you have to tip me now because my shift is over is a bit too much , considering the fact that he basically did not do anything special .. I had to go look for him so I can get the tickets for my luggage. That was incredible. Checkout was a mess the lady checking me out was rude, dismissive and was asking me questions and then talking over me as I was answering . I will never return and definatly not recommend your hotel. I am sure that due to the location you will not suffer much because of that and honestly I think that’s why your staff is acting like that, knowing that you will get business due to the location and low rates ",11/18/18,1
We asked to upgrade the room after first day of stay since the room was too small with extra money and were there told that we need to check out at 12:00 and wait in the lobby untill 16:00 to check in. And this was not because the room was not available but the rules of the hotel.,11/17/18,2
"The rooms and bathrooms are tiny and very poor cleanliness. I felt insecure all the time, was dark and with a rare elevator system. I think will never return to Row. The only good thing was location. Sorry to the staff, they was ok ",11/17/18,2
"Good localization and next to subway, Times Square, restaurants, pubs, shops. Even in full 8th Avenue the room is quite silent and with view. The service is good and the fast services, including the parcel delivery servic ",11/17/18,4
"Great location but wouldn't stay again. Room was very small, couldn't maneuver with two people in the room. Carpet needed cleaning and the air conditioner was so loud we had to turn it off. Staff was nice. ",11/17/18,2
"In NY, location is important. Hotel has done a great job of updating the halls and rooms. Rooms are spotless and fitness facility is awesome. We LOVED the breakfast staff at District M. Plenty, efficient, great variety of continental pastry options. Fitness facility great and walking distance to everything (as long as you like long walks and I do) to everything in NYC. Limited concierge service if you don;t already know what you want and you have a resort fee which seems like a tacked on charge but that is NYC. Great location for Broadway andx walking back after the show ",11/17/18,4
"We booked the stay at ebookers.com. You guys need to put the right picture of the room for the right room-option. There were many sizes of the bed on the pictures and so we didn’t know what we were gonna get. We emailed the hotel and asked for a queen-size minimum. the response was copy pasted and was not really an answer. So we get to the hotel, after waitinf 20min in a line we check in with a guy. Again, we ask to reveice a qeen size at least and the guy says that we actually got an upgrade so we don’t need to worry. We wait another 20min to be able to get an elevator til we get inside our room. It’s a fullsize bed. A little bigger than a single bed. Shower was dirty and the towels had stains. The room has no food/water. I took the empty bottles and came upon 3 not working machines before i finally found a working one. The next day we told someone at the check in about the room situation and she told us that the they’re fully booked, so we had to sleep another night there. We considered leaving the hotel. We went to the check-in again and asked again. We finally got a room with a little bigger bed. The room actually had a nice view. Which was pretty much the only good thing about our stay at the ROW NYC. The elevator situation is a problem. I don’t wanna wait 10min to get an elevator everytime i wanna get up to my room. It was absolutely not worth the money i am really really disappointed ",11/17/18,2
"We arrived from the airport and within 7 mins of leaving our bags we were in Times Square. The hotel is ideally situated to see New York. Port Authority bus terminal is close by as are a few subway stations. Prices are reasonable for New York. Yes the rooms are a bit small and while the premises doesn't have the smell of fresh paint it was clean and tidy and serviced daily. The beds were comfortable too. Unusually for New York, street noise was minimal. Staff were pleasent and helpful. Continental breakfast is available in the district M bar and is adequate. The City Kitchen is gives many choices without being a rip-off. Plenty of food choices in the area too. Overall a great base for a break in New York ",11/16/18,5
"I was very displeased from the moment I got there, did not get bag assistance and I was traveling with elderly and children. I was also very disappointed with check in as the room I was upgraded to was not actually available because of painting. I was not told anything about the hotel or accomations and had trouble finding my room. The internet access did not work. The pullout couch was very uncomfortable and the sheets we were given had tears in them. Upon checkout I called for a luggage cart for and waited 30 mins and still never received one so I had to make two trips down. Overall just expected a decent experience. We only stayed for one night. Very disappointed with the hotel and staff. ",11/16/18,1
"thanks for everything ROW!! good service, room always clean and great location near of times squareThanks especially to the attendant Junior!! excellent professionals and they also speak portuguese thats easier for me (Im brazilian)I recommend this hotel for everybody ",11/16/18,5
"As you enter the hotel, it all looks a bit tired although the rooms looked fine. It has quite a small bar area with some steps opposite that people were just lounging around on, a bit strange. It does have a great food area where there are about 7 different choices of food although there was very little seating. Not a bad location but not the smartest hotel in the neighbourhood ",11/16/18,3
At the back of broadway and Junior’s restaurant. This hotel is easily accessible to Port Authority Bus Terminal. One street away from Times Square and Shake Shack or Five Guys. You can walk to Times Square or it’s mass rapid station. Small room and thin walls/ doors making you here the neighbours talks or slam doors. Opening the window anywhere in the hotel rooms ensure you here the constant blasting of NYPD or NYFD sounding their horns all day Long.,11/15/18,3
"This hotel is grungy, old and smells. The rooms are half the size of a normal hotel room and we paid $340 USD a night. Would not come back and would not recommend. But I will say the location is good that’s the only good thing ",11/15/18,1
"Good central hotel, clean, lot of noise from the street even at 14. floor, the window was leaky and it was very cold close to the window. The heater made a lot of noise and we decided not to use is. The wifi worked impeccable. We asked for for blankets 3 times before we finally got them. ",11/15/18,4
"If you are interested in a closet size room and dirty doesn’t bother you, the value of the room is sufficient. Went to a trip for work and it was on a list for recommendations to stay. I would request for it to be removed. Pictures are deceiving. ",11/15/18,1
My husband two daughters and I thoroughly enjoyed! We were in the middle of everything!! Our first trip as a family to NYC-couldn’t of ask for a better place to stay in! Beds and pillows were very comfortable and the place was clean,11/15/18,5
I was impressed by the generosity and excelent service of Junior. It was an amazing suprise he is Brazilian. He made me feel at home and give me all the information (a looot of) I was asking him. The room service was good. The location is exceptional. The internet is also great! Congrats Row. You rock,11/15/18,4
Row NYC is very conveniently located just off Times Square. The rooms are quite small and the bathrooms tiny but it was clean and affordable for the heart of the theater district. Our receptionist at check in was not very friendly but got her job done,11/15/18,3
Great location but seems management is not very good - my room was not clean at all with hair clipping still in my sink and tissue and gum wrappers under my nicely made bed. Calling the front desk is worse than calling the DMV department - took for ever to get a hold of a live person,11/15/18,2
"My wife and I have recently stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, the location is perfect if you want to stay at Times Square and was only a 10-15 minute walk to some of the sights like Central Park, Rockefeller centre, Macy’s and Maddison square garden. The hotel was perfect for us because we booked it for the excellent location, however if you want a luxury hotel this is not for you, but when in NYC you are never in the hotel so overall it was good value for money ",11/15/18,3
Excellent value. Staff very friendly and welcoming. The hotel is in a prime position for restaurants theatres etc within easy reach of Times square.It really exceeded my expectations.I would definitely stay there agai,11/15/18,5
"I've stayed at the Row several times and appreciate the ease of navigating the city. Subway stop is around the corner, only two blocks from Times Square, rooms are not spacious, but clean and comfortable. Staff is friendly and helpful ",11/15/18,4
"great location to get around in ny. It was very central location to everything so it made walking very easy to access most things that you want to see. not to far from central park, time square, 5th ave ",11/15/18,4
"Hotel was great location, clean and comfy bed. Great value and just great for a trip where you are our most of the day and need somewhere comfortable to crash at the end of the evening. Didn’t have breakfast at the hotel but if you walk slightly away from Times Square, there are several good value diners and bakeries for breakfast. ",11/15/18,4
"I’ve stayed at Row NYC Hotel twice now. It’s just so convenient with one of the best locations in the city. Rooms are definitely on the small side, so go for an upgrade and it’s much nicer. Modern, safe, and literally a block away from Times Square. I love the vibe of this hotel and probably will happily stay again :) Thanks Row ",11/14/18,4
The only good thing about this hotel is the location. Expensive gun down oh and don’t forget the 100 dollar deposit even though they have your credit card on file. Staff is unfriendlyThe worst being kerion the manager. He has no idea what customer relationship means. You won’t see me here again.,11/14/18,1
"Simple hotel, not quite as nice as the photos make it look but fantastic location if you don't know the city and need to go all over. Friendly staff and pleasant stay. No complaints. Rooms are fine if you're just sleeping there and going out in the city. For a romantic trip or special occasion it wasn't quite as nice as I was expecting ",11/14/18,3
"They charge you a facilities fee for services that hotels usually offer (e.g. water, WiFi, fitness room). Location is excellent, but the building is run-down and the room was dirty. Staff at the front desk are absolutely clueless ",11/14/18,2
Very basic small rooms. No mini fridge. No kettle. No coffee/tea. No bottled water. Free wifi. Only plus is location. Next to all the broadway theatres and 5min walk to Times Square. Gym with 5 treadmills from 6am to 8pm,11/14/18,3
"We mostly enjoyed our stay but some thoughts are a bit mixed. Our room was clean, well maintained by the lovely housekeeping staff, and although it was small it was functional. Check-in was very pleasant, the lady we had was helpful and nice. Check-out however I waited in in the lobby with three staff all staring at a computer and not acknowledging me, I had to call out multiple times to get anyones attention. The iPads for express check out had been removed which was odd. The service was not a nice note to leave on.To echo the comments on here regarding the elevators - what a nightmare! They are small and overworked, so make sure to factor in waiting time for one before you need to leave for the day/come back. Area was always packed with people constantly punching in their floor, calling multiple elevators out of frustration so when you're finally in one - you have to stop at floors with no one getting off because people kept touching it. People will also push past you because they don't understand queues. No fault of the ROW's - more so of other travellers! Also thin walls so heard everyones loud conversations. Location was great being very close to Times Square a ton of restaurants and theatres, but not as much foot traffic going by. Plenty of taxis available but had issues catching an Uber.Was pleasantly surprised to know taxis have a flat rate to and from JFK too which was a big help ",11/14/18,3
I love to stay in the ROW NYC because of the wonderful guest services and the location. The rooms are very comfortable and very clean. The staff is very nice and having City Kitchen for breakfasts is great,11/14/18,5
"Had a very pleasant stay. Location is superb, walking distance from many attractions and on a not so busy street. The room was comfortable, spacious and clean. The facilities in general are well maintained. ",11/14/18,4
"Very crowded. The cleaning crew decided to clean the main stairs in and out of the hotel on Sunday morning at 8 am - 9 am, a prime time for people checking out. Everyone was forced to take one of the two small elevators to arrive or leave. Seems there would be a better time to do this. Cracker crumbs and other pieces of food in the elevators to the rooms the entire 3 days I was there. I could hear the people in the room next door all night, thought the sound proofing would be better ",11/14/18,3
"We travelled to NYC for the first time this September. We had searched around quite a lot to find a decent hotel as NYC is very expensive.We came across Row Hotel online and the pictures and location looked ideal. When we arrived to the hotel the staff were friendly and attentive considering our flight was delayed and we got in at 3am. Once we got to our room we couldn't believe how small and noisy it was and didn't look like the images online. It was a very rundown looking place. We could hear people walking up and down the hallways, slamming doors and also using the ice machine. It was as if the walls were really thin. We had a leak in our room which we ended up moving to another room which was a lot bigger and quieter as it was at the end of the hallway, but the bathroom was sooooo tiny I could barely fit. Overall the hotel was ok, it was affordable for our budget and was very close to Times Square. I am not sure we would stay here again ",11/13/18,3
"Definitely not worth the price of admission here. Need to improve fundamental aspects of a hotel experience: Cleanliness, Engaged Staff, Transparency with customers. It's expected that you'll find expensive hotel rooms all across NYC, but your dollar could definitely go further elsewhere. ",11/13/18,1
"The best thing about the ROW NYC is the location-2 blocks from Times Square, in the heart of the theater district. The lobby and bar look to have been refurbished recently, the rooms themselves are small and worn but reasonably clean. There is limited closet space but a few deep drawers for storage. Queen size bed was very comfortable. Bathroom is very small - don't drop anything in the shower! The elevator system causes a lot of lobby congestion and long waits - you enter the desired floor, are directed to one of 8 elevator banks and then wait. When it arrives, it is supposed to go directly to your indicated floor but that isn't always what happens. Can be quite frustrating. Didn't try any of the food offered. Bartender was very friendly but drinks expensive, even for NYC. Overall, if I found a good price I would stay there again because of the location ",11/13/18,3
We liked that it was literally 1 block from Times Square. Rooms were small but it wasn’t dirty. There was a hair dryer and iron. Ice machine available. Overall it was good. Considering the price of everywhere else in that area.,11/13/18,3
had some issues with the first room and had to change rooms. staff was accommodating. The second room could have been cleaner and was missing towels. Cleanliness got better the next day. Room had been updated but still shows its age by the number of times things had been painted over and repaired,11/13/18,3
"Before we stayed I sent an email explaining that we were on honeymoon and if they could give me some recommendations. Am still waiting for the reply! Anyways we checked in on Saturday only to be told that a room with a double bed wasn’t available until the next day. That we could stay in that room and could be moved but this is not what you want to hear (1) after an 8 hour flight (2) after you booked a specific room (3) as newlyweds! We were offered a room with 2 double beds which I guess is better than a twin! Am not sure what our room would have been like but you can tell it is a very old hotel that has been done up several times over.The bathroom wasn’t very clean, a bit dusty and in fact some of the tiles are still dirty now. Some of the paint work in the door frame is bubbly tooThe situation with the elevators / lifts is a joke - sometimes waiting for ages! It is very noisy but you are bang in the centre of town. That being said.... the location is what you want - just a block away from Times Square. So I guess that’s what you are paying for. Lots of places to eat and drink nearby and the food court at the hotel isn’t too busy so you can escape the hustle and bustle. WiFi is good here too and free. Would have been to have had a fridge but not essential.In all I would say this is a 3 star hotel ",11/13/18,3
"Location (5*): The Row NYC is so conveniently located in the Theater District-Times Square area, without having to be on the Broadway street itself. I happened to attend a play at the Booth Theater so it was perfect for me. Even power-walked to TKTS to get a discount ticket. Got coffee in the hotel lobby before catching a ride-share or a taxi out front. Room (3*): I’ve been to NYC 5x, so I know to expect small hotel rooms. Granted it’s only my 2nd time ever at a hotel. I hardly ever complain and can tolerate long queues, inconveniences ....but I deduct 2 stars of 5 because of the window-sill air/heat unit that is freakin’ loud! Blowing heat is fine; not too noisy, but blowing cold air on auto mode through the night (it gets stuffy with 4 adults) drove me insane!! I am a light sleeper, and the noise is basically comparable to when you’re travelling on an airplane. The looooow grumbling noise which I found more annoying. Stayed 4 nights and I nearly wanted to book a hotel room across the street at the Intercontinental above the Shake Shack. I had restless nights and busy days. I did manage to borrow noise-cancelling headphones from a member of my group. Shower pressure in bathtub was decent. Showing signs of wear and tear but I can tolerate that. Vanity area had plenty of room and the all-around white lighted mirror was helpful for makeup application. Just really bright when you’re tired! Lol. Almost didn’t know how to close the hotel room door because the deadlock (not the additional deadbolt) automatically comes out, and when you leave the room... gotta give the inside door handle a quick “unlock” and the lock will go back inside, so I can properly close the door. No issue with keycard. Housekeeping was great! I like to say hello to them and they’re friendly. Got our room cleaned every day and got extra supplies. Elevators were always zippy-fast for me as no one ever seemed to be on my floor, so when I press my floor button in advance and go to the assigned elevator... I’m usually alone, even during peak hours. Yay! PRO TIP: 1) try to stay in a hotel room at the back of the hotel. Our room was overlooking 8th Ave and nothing like NY noise at night that contributes to restlessness. Only handy part was the air unit being louder than the late night noise. Hehh...2) Get a 10% discount when you show your hotel room key while souvenir shopping at the gift shop “I Love NY Gifts by Phantom of Broadway” that’s just to the left of front door (when facing street) attached to hotel. ",11/13/18,3
"The hotel Location is great. Really near to shops attractions and restaurants and shops.the only thing i didnt like was the way the lifts worked. you would expect to get in and press the floor you want and off you go but these you press the floor you need and an arrow points you to which lift will arrive and the everyone tries to pile in all at once. other than that no other complaints. Rooms were comfortable and clean, the maids were brilliant and friendly and the other hotel staff helpful too. definately worth a stay here and priced well too ",11/13/18,4
Not the best place to relax specially after a day of walking around the city or a day full of meetings where you simply want to rest. Depends what you enjoy maybe for some people that kind of energy is a positive things.,11/13/18,3
"The Row NYC is a wonderful, contemporary hotel! Great location to anything Times Square, shows, shopping, easy access to subway, and more. My room was nice and clean. I love the use of color in them. The staff, no matter where I bumped into them, were exceptional. Kind and professional. This wasn’t my first stay here and it won’t be my last. Thanks Row! ",11/12/18,5
But in a “not usual” hotel. The Row NYC - with the most incredible Front Desk Staff ever!!! I travel 2-3 days a week -takes a lot to impress me ....... but they did it here! I will be back! Their personal touch is great,11/12/18,5
This was a great location and a nice place to stay. Rooms were a good size and so was the bathroom. Memory foam mattress was very comfy. Staff very polite and room was clean. Other than a small amount of noise from next door i can't fault the row. Well worth the money,11/12/18,5
"Row NYC is a great location within a couple of minutes your in Time Square and very close for the Broadway,friendly staff and great for breakfast hotel also has a kitchen which has about 6/7 different food stall ",11/12/18,4
"The first room we had was terrible. Shower head squeaked, toilet flush lasted forever and the aircon was rattling. Staff helpful and changed rooms next day. Was much better but sadly the pipes that led from the above rooms toilet was exposed in the wardrobe so room smelt like a sewer. Fire alarm went off one night. We were told to stay in our rooms. Didn’t feel safe if there was an emergency. Didn’t communicate very well. Location was good but definitely wouldn’t stay there again. ",11/12/18,3
"The Row provided great proximity to the theatre district in NYC. It was under 400 feet from the Majetic Theatre, home to Phantom of the Opera, the longest running play on Broadway. Other theatres are also nearby. Many dining choices nearby and lots of dining opportunities.The main level is not well managed for limiting non guest occupancy. The elevators to rooms do keep non guests from proceeding ",11/11/18,4
"The hotel smells funny, it’s not the cleanest but the staff is very friendly. Good sleep but the AC makes sounds. Location is amazing, walking distance to many touristy places. Most of the guest were young people ",11/11/18,3
"Dark hallways, felt run down, really busy and loud lobby scene. Had confirmed reservation for room with City View but they didn’t have any left when I checked in at 4pm. I won’t stay here again. I’d rather pay a little more - if at all - and have cleaner, brighter, quieter room - probably bigger too - that was a tight fit ",11/11/18,3
"I stayed at the Row from November 8-11th and I greatly enjoyed my stay. This was my first solo trip to NYC the staff and location of the hotel was perfect. I got to the hotel around 1300pm and Nellie at the front desk not only let me check in early but upgraded my hotel room since it was my first time in NYC. My hotel room was very clean and the staff very professional. I recommend The Row for anyone who wants to be close to everything the subway , Times Square , restaurants etc. I will definitely come back to the Row again. Thank you for making my first solo trip to NYC very enjoyable and comfortable ",11/11/18,5
The hotel is in a great location near everything. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Rooms are clean and very nice size in very good views of the city. Looking forward to going back to New York and definitely will be staying at ROW NY,11/11/18,5
"The hotel seemed promising. Although, staff was pleasant, rooms were not. Hallway smelled like a sewer, tiny rooms and bathroom drainage system poor. Way overpriced, next time I will search for another hotel ",11/11/18,3
"My daughter, my best friend and myself stayed at The Row NYC November 8th-10th 2018. I have stayed in this hotel 15+ times and they are all about their customer service. The front desk is the face of the hotel, Kathy is the employee that has made my experiences even better. This young woman has an amazing work ethic. She goes above and beyond. It is a wonderful feeling to be recognized and greeted, I felt so valued as a customer. Also to be commended are Karina and Tommy who are a part of the management team. They are an asset of their company. Thank you for making this trip so memorable. Our room was incredible!! Beautifully decorated and very clean. The huge bathroom with the walk in jet shower was an added bonus. We love everything about this hotel. The staff, the security, the location. Next time your visiting NYC plan to stay at The Row NYC.

"The hotel is in a great location to Times Square, the room wasn’t the cleanest,I was on the 14th floor and could hear the underground! The price was expensive for 3 nights and no breakfast included I paid close to £1,000 once I got there ",11/9/18,3
The front desk Representative and Operations Manager Tommy made disaster for Guest when she was trying check in Row NYC Hotel - The email receipt which was paid in full was presented but this was not enough proof to allow her to check in -After approximately 45 minutes then my Guest was allowed to check in -My Guest was never given information to how utilize $75.00 food voucher and other amenities of hotel -I would NOT advise any of my friends or family to stay at Row NYC -Thumbs Down for this hotel,11/9/18,1
"I would not return to this hotel, nor would I refer to anyone else. Our room was very dingy and dirty. The lobby and bar area were decent but other than that the hotel was seriously run down and in need of a deep clean ",11/9/18,2
"Had the worst start to my holiday in NYC when the shuttle service we used to get from the airport lost my partners suitcase (Supershuttle for anyone wanting to know who not to use!!). We arrived at ROW NYC and basically after what seemed like the longest day I was in tears over the lost case. The staff here at Row (particularly Christina on reception) went above and beyond to help turn our miserable day around. She was so thoughtful and attentive and all the staff we have since met around reception and the rest of the hotel have also been super polite and helpful. The hotel is modern, clean and the reception and bar area stylish and lively at night. Our room has a lovely view of the city! I was warned before my arrival by friends that it would be noisy at night but I slept great at ROW NYC and barely heard any city noise! I honestly felt our treatment by SuperShuttle was disgusting but the staff at Row restored my faith in the people of New York and I would definitely recommend ",11/8/18,5
"Very fast and efficient check in by Paula. Room on 26th floor. Very large corner room ,well equipped with double aspect windows. Plenty of space and storage. Hotel close to Times Square and subways. Would definitely recommend as a base for a New York trip. Can't comment on restaurant as ate out ever day. ",11/8/18,5
"Bad vibes, bad smells and a mattress of your nightmares. You also get to pay a $32/night resort fee to fill up a container from a drinking fountain, which they call ""bottled water."" This resort fee is not standard in NYC, by the way. Dirty, tediously slow elevators with thousands of people in them -- good luck getting to your meeting on time! Also, do you like the smell of burnt grease? I promise -- you can find better value and a more special experience in many other hotels in the city. ",11/8/18,1
"The location and the attention of the desk attendants were excellent, with good tips and courtesy in the service.The lay-out of the bars and rest I found perfectAnd the express check-out was also very practica ",11/8/18,5
Got to check in early which was nice. Great location. Elevators are fast. Not too noisy so sleep was no problem. Access to city kitchen with discount is nice although I did not eat there. I liked the stadium seating near the bar - that looked like it would be fun.,11/8/18,5
"All good, the hotel was fab, The rooms were comfy, need more usb plugs in there, only problem was we were not too happy with cleanliness of rooms under the beds very dirty, also cleaner was quite abrupt and came too early. The staff were all lovely and very helpful  ",11/8/18,4
"The room can be very small on the low end but exactly what you need and nothing more. Stylish & trendy. There is a very nice bar/lounge area that is convenient for a quick cocktail or meetings. Attached are nice food-stalls/ court with seating for convenience. Definitely a go-to place for midtown, Times Square area ",11/7/18,5
"No heat, weak water pressure in the shower, lukewarm water, moldy grimy window unit, room keys didn’t work, 30 mins to get an elevator up to the room because of crowding. Too much money for filthy, terrible hospitality. Avoid. Go anywhere else. ",11/7/18,1
"I found a cockroach in my room & house keeping only cleaned my room once in four nights. Another colleague said their room was dusty. Another colleague said someone came into their room at 1am which obviously causes then panic, areas and alarm. Finally the lift system is absolutely stupid. If there was a fire, no one would survive. I was in the lift with a drunk man who was pretty much passed out and a hotel worker who obviously asked for my assistance. For where the hotel is located, it is shambioloc. The decor is outrageously cheap & distateful I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to my worst enem ",11/7/18,1
"We had a very good experience at ROW Hotel, the location is perfect and close to everything. The staff were friendly, the room was clean and neat, we even got an upgrade to a room with a great view of 7th Ave ",11/7/18,5
"Very noisy, particularly at night time, due to heavy traffic on 8th Ave. and continuous horning by cars and trucks, taxis, emergency, policy and fire dept. cars.At peak time, it takes forever to get from/to floors/entrance. Despite a paid upgrade, got a room facing rear side on 8th floor from where you could see and particularly hear a gigantic ventilator (guess on top of garage). When on, sounded like a warmup of a Boeing airplane before taking off …. after next morning complaint got a better room but had to check-out by 12 am and check in again at 4 pm. On positive side, Hotel granted a discount for that first night ",11/7/18,3
Nice Hotel with great location. The rooms although kind of small were clean and nice. I will suggest the offer of coffee maker at rooms. The market provide different options for food and were very good. The best part: Locatio,11/7/18,4
"First impression, reception area nice. Requested twin but got a double a sign of things to come. Very small room for 2 sharing. Corridors dimly lit think its meant to be a feature, all we felt was it masked the shabbyness. From other patrons we seen coming and going this is a hotel used by aircrew on stopovers. Not somewhere to stay more than one night. Wouldn't recommend at all. Very disappointed ",11/6/18,2
"Check in: When we arrived (around 2am) there was one person on the desk and a long queue of people waiting. The manager came out to deal with a pilot who refused to stay in his room as it was too dirty and was demanding another room immediately and also a guest who had found a cockroach in his bed! The manager looked at the long queue and just went back inside instead of helping to check in guests. There was some confusion as the hotel had offered my an upgrade option a few days prior to arrival, which I had taken up. Check-in staff were confused and I had to convince them that I had taken up the upgrade offer. Finally got the room. Walked into the bathroom to find someone had used the toilet and not flushed! Bed and duvet were uncomfortable and poor quality. Check out seemed fine until I realised they had charged me twice for the room. I tried to call around 8 times but was unable to get through to anyone. Eventually I had to go back and talk to someone in person. The lady was very rude and was insisting that I had booked 2 rooms for the same nights. To which ai replied, when I checked in, why wasn’t I given two keys? To which she said she didn’t know who had checked me in and so was unable to comment. She was very blunt and very insistent! I managed to find an email on my phone, which proved I had booked only one room and then her tone changed completely and she became very polite. Finally got the refund through ",11/6/18,3
"Check in was very slow for a large hotel. Do not get rooms near lifts as sound like a subway tunnel. Bar very expensive, However location is good for NY sightseeing. Near times square and all the hustle and bustle ",11/6/18,3
"Location is good and the price of the rooms usually reasonable too. The hotel is generally reasonably clean, but certainly doesn’t have a sparklingly clean feel to it. The gym is reasonable except none of the TVs on the cardio equipment work and the equipment is a bit dated (how about a few Watt bikes for example). Had the breakfast option which is fine, 1 fruit, 1 pastry, a cold hard boiled egg, a juice and a coffee.. ",11/6/18,3
"I spend a night with my family for the Marathon there. What can I say? It's going to be my last stay. Of course, the Location is outstanding, you're in the middle of the crowd but that's the best you can say about this hotel. We room was samll and dirty, stains on the carpet and on the blankets. There was mold in the bathroom and stains on the faucets. . I spent more than USD 400 and for breakfast I was allowed to get only one one coffee, one pastry, one egg or one banana and for any extra items I had to pay. ",11/6/18,1
"Fantastic location, small rooms but clean . Location may be good for sight seeing however it was very noisy. If you check in late in the day often only rooms left are near the lifts which increases the noise level. Staff are helpfu ",11/6/18,3
"Lovely hotel,and lovely staff especially Douglas in reception and check in...we were not happy with the room allocated at first as it had a view of a wall and a huge pipe.. depressing dingy room...but on our complaint..he offered to upgrade us to a premium room which had a briliant view of times square but far enough away to be able to relax..all of the staff in reception are excellent..as is cleaners, maintenance were all very polite.The bathrooms need a much needed refurbishment.. although it was spotlessy clean. The location is brilliant so close to central park,subway.. times square,shopping, it is great..! ",11/6/18,4
"The rooms were small and not super clean, but ok the location is fairly good, but use to staying right in Times Square. We got a good price which made it worth it. We didn't spend much time in the hotel but the fact that it had food was nice. ",11/6/18,3
"The central location is great for crashing overnight after a show. No fuss, quick checkout and usually have good deals. The rooms are small and not kept very well, you see the age of the building the a/c was too noisy and was hardly working ",11/6/18,3
"I've give high ratings for the location and accessibility of subway. Rooms are clean, not big, but that is New York City. My only complaint is that there were other guests ( a huge group of teenagers) who were staying at the same time, and they were noisy both early in the morning and also late at night. I couldn't sleep well because they kept knocking on their friends' room doors loudly, and had no regard for other guests. My second complain was that room service walked into my room twice without knocking on the door. The first time i was in the shower and only after entering, they said 'room service"" - i had to scream from the shower that I was still inside. The second was in the morning - same thing, no knocks, and just entered, the moment she saw me, she stepped out and not even a word of apology. Luckily this time i had clothes on! ",11/6/18,3
"The hotel is located perfectly near Times Square, overall good service, the room could have been cleaner, and we would have liked to be able to have our luggage stay longer after check-out, because we had a late flight. ",11/5/18,4
"Great location, very close to theaters and restaurants. High noise level in room. LOTS of tourist groups, which led to a very crowded bar and lobby. Only average bathroom amenities. Good service, friendly housekeeping staff ",11/5/18,4
"At 2am the Fire Alarm strobe light started flashing in our room. The staff in the hotel seemed entirely unprepared for dealing with the situation. There was not adequate communication with guests in my view. We had to make our own decisions to evacuate in the end. Then after fire crews had left, we were told to go back to our rooms, where the strobe light alarm was still flashing. We thought it was unsafe to stay in a room when the alarm was still flashing, so we evacuated again. When a public address system was finally made, I thought it was in a foreign language, until it was made in Spanish. I truly believe that if there had been a genuine emergency, people’s lives would have been put at risk. Apart from that, the rooms are newly refurbished, but it’s an old style hotel, so there is only so much you can do. Noise in that part of town is an issue. We were on the 25th floor and you just hear constant hooting and sirens 24/7. Location is very central, so that’s a plus. ",11/5/18,1
This hotel is in a great location and right around the corner from time square. The reception area was very up to date. The service was excellent and the staff couldn’t help us enough. The rooms were small but just big enough. Overall very good hotel and will stay there again,11/5/18,4
"I would stay at the ROW hotel again, simply because the location was great. The food court inside it was also very convenient. The heater in the room was noisy though and it took three attempts to get someone to replace a malfunctioning remote control for the TV. The wifi was pretty weak too, but the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. If you can get used to the heater noise, it's a good place to stay in Times Square ",11/5/18,4

"Reservation was for a deluxe queen room with a city view. The room size was small and the queen bed barely fit and did not leave much space for us to move around. Bathroom was VERY small as one person struggled to fit without opening the door while at the sink.As for the view, it was obstructed by part of the facade of the building (26 floor). Our last visit was so much better for the same type of a room. The reservation included the small continental breakfast which allowed us a single juice, single pastry, single hardboiled egg, and a cup of coffee for each of us. While we are not big eaters for breakfast, the limit on what you may consume seems silly. Unfortunately, this hotel was great previously but is now in our mind just another overpriced NYC stay ",11/5/18,3
"Overall a nice stay, but we had to change to a larger room as the standard room with Queen size bed was too small for two persons (mother and daughter). Hotel cost increased from the planned budget. Mixed service level among the staff, some very kind, some almost rude. Clean rooms. Very close to subway, theaters and other sightseeing spots ",11/4/18,3
Perfectly located very close to Times Square and many Theaters. Rooms are small as usual in New York but o.k. Food court offers many options for breakfast and in between. I was already here several times and come back more or less every time when I am in New York,11/4/18,4
"This is my 3rd time staying here. First time was great! loved the location. 2nd time we had broken A/C issues which was fixed promptly so I wasnom with it. I figured we’ll give them another shot. 3rd time was the worst! Broken A/C...again! Maintenance deemed A/C can’t be fixed promptly so he attempted to call reception to notify them we need to change rooms. No one answered the phone. After numerous attempts, we decided to just go down to reception. They apologized and said we will be assigned to a new “upgraded” room. That was a laugh, as the new room was even smaller! Next day we were to check out at 12pm, around 11 we were almost done packing when staff knocked on our door to notify us that a cleaning crew is scheduled to clean the windows. I acknowledged thinking he meant they’re cleaning the windows from the outside and was giving us a heads up for privacy. I was wrong. The window cleaning staff barged into our room. Mind you this room was like a shoe box so he hit our luggage and almost hit me as I was placing my things in the bag when it happened. They couldn’t just wait until after checkout? A knock on the door would have been nice too instead of just entering the room unannounced. Will never go back again ",11/4/18,1
Had a fantastic time staying at The Row. Very nice staff warm and friendly. Always was happy to answer any questions. Had to change rooms however very accommodating to move us next day without question. I would deffinatly stay there again. Great location to get to places too.,11/4/18,5
"The room was clean, tidy and comfortable. Bring earplugs for the first night or 2 (especially if staying at the front of the hotel) as the Times Square area tends to have a lot of emergency services driving by. You do get used to the noise after 2 nights We went to the Westway Diner for breakfast every morning which fills you up for most of the day!! Been using this diner since 2005 and it's still as tasty now as it was then. The hotel is extremely central and within walking distance of a lot of the main touristy sites ",11/4/18,4
"I would not recommend anyone to go here. To many hidden fees for a tiny room. Then the hallways looks dark and kinda creepy. The good thing I can say for this hotel is that it’s conveniently location to a lot of stores,bars,et ",11/3/18,1
I think I lucked out on this one because I went after the New Years buzz and ended up in a wheelchair accessible room so it was probably bigger than most in that price range $180 for two nights which was pretty good for New York especially that close to time square. No view in my room but when you’re so close to times Square anyway go and explore! The hotel itself has a whole team of helpful porters and a funky New York food court right there in the building if you’re not quite ready to brave the city yet,11/3/18,4
The Air conditionning was really noisy. Impossible to switch on at night to sleep well. The finish touch is not very welldone and the look and feel of the room is old. I am very disapointed by the room. I can’t imagine the hôtel is a 4 stars.,11/3/18,2
I must say we read some poor reviews and had been warned personally about the long check ins but we had absolutely no trouble with our stay! We were first checked in to a lower floor with no view but as we got to the floor a very nice gentleman advised us that they were working on the room next door and would be loud so he would find us another room. We requested an outside facing view initially but said was fully booked and could not get us one (which is fair enough). We requested again to the gentleman who was swapping our rooms and he managed to get us into a higher floor front facing room with a great view of New York! We got very lucky. Also prior to checking in we expected a login check in which we gave ourselves time for but there was no line at all (around 2pm) and when we checked out (around 11:30am) also had no lines. Although you could express check out if need be online/self counters. We an amazing experience at the Row and got a bit lucky but still would stay there again as the location is the best you could get and the rooms were clean and tidied daily. Few minor faults:Nothing to reduce the ratings for but the elevator can take forever!!! Have a weird system where you type your floor number and points you to an elevator which is fine but sometimes can be full after waiting a few minutes so have to take the next one which could take another few minutes. Bed was a bit less comforable than expected and pillows were lumpy but we managed to sleep 5 nights comfortably. No coffee or water provided in the room.4.5/5 from me,11/3/18,5
Stayed overnight to have dinner & see Broadway show with friends. Hotel is very nice. Front desk staff was fantastic & friendly. Wasn’t happy with the water pressure in the shower. Internet wouldn’t connected. Guess too many people trying to use the internet.,11/2/18,4
"These is my thoughts on our stay:When we first checked in we were assigned to Room 2531. Our first impression was that we have a closet for a room. There wasn't even room for our luggage. The TV didn't work. We couldn't get internet services. We we went down to the front desk to express our concerns. The person at the desk was understanding and switched us to Room 1012. It was a lot better, but not perfect.We requested several things of which only one was taken care of. We asked for more hangers and never got them. I asked that the vent in the bathroom be cleaned as it was really dusty, and it was never done. The battery in our clock radio has a flashing battery indicator, I asked for it to be changed and it never was.On a side note there is a metal access panel next to the toilet and is rusty. Obviously, no one ever wipes it. The front desk never answers our calls ",11/2/18,3
"We are only home today from a wonderful stay at Row. From the moment we arrive and were checked in by Junior we were made to feel so welcome and my 9 year old daughter treated like a princess. He was so helpful and gave us wonderful recommendations for food and for fun things we might enjoy with the little one. The rooms was wonder on the 24th floor with a fantastic view, yes they are small and yes it’s noisy but it’s NYC those are a given. The rooms were clean and maintained well daily as were the communal areas. The location on 8th avanue was superb. All in all I would hand over heart recommended this hotel and will be back. I would like to give special thanks to Junior who checked ya in and to Marnie who checked us out both went above and beyond ",11/2/18,5
"I love the location for the cost. The overall setup is quite well designed. The Sugar Factory, adjacent to The Row, is fun and serves a good breakfast even after the other restaurants have quit serving breakfast for the day ",11/2/18,5
"THis is right in the heart of times square. if youre from a major city, reconsider staying here. Way busier than the normal hotel. However, this was right by everything, we walked all over. I had fun being able to just walk a couple blocks and just being in the mix, however the trash and noise late at night was craz ",11/2/18,4
We had an amazing view for a reasonable price. The location is great! The service was good. The hotel restaurant was also good. If your going to see a broadway show this is a good location to stay. Lots of restaurants nearby,11/2/18,5
"Been there for a long weekend with my son oct. 2018. Central location, clean and spacious room, frienly staff made the stay very good. Easy to get there and near to main city attractions.I will recomend to my friends for sure ",11/2/18,5
"We have stayed the hotel in one week.But we felt the noisy, poor travel ameneities, worse communications among staff.We don't use any gym or facility ,but we must pay the extra expensive facility fee ",11/1/18,3
"We went for my husband's birthday. We had a ball. Hotel is a short walk from Broadway shows, Times square, Central park, location was Excellent! Decor In the rooms a bit dated but you don't spend much time in the room anyway! House keeping in every day, staff lovely and helpful with directions, taxis, helping print boarding passes. Etc. Breakfast lovely, we included it in our booking, well worth it.. coffee, juices, fresh fruit, an egg and a pastry every morning, great start to the day! A bit noisy by night, but then you are In the heart of the city! They also sent up a bottle of wine to the room for my husband's birthday! Would definately go back! ",11/1/18,4
"Be ware! The hotel charges you an additional RESORT fee of $30 dollars plus tax a day ($40 per day). The fee includes very unnecessary services such as gym access, bottled water and coupon in the city. The hotel will tell you that you are not to reject the fee. They tell you they have the right to legally charge you these cost even if you don't want to use it. They said we, as guests, do not have the right to decline these additional service.In addition, they won't cancel with refunds, if you refuse to pay for the resort fee and want to cancel the reservation. More, after trying to reason and dispute this fee with the hotel manager on duty on the evening of 10/21/2018, he downgraded me to a worst, smallest, and the noisiest room in the hotel right between the Janitor's closet and the elevators to spite of my inquiry. Even though his friendly staff member offered me an upgrade initially, for a room that is quiet and with a view! This type of action taken by the hotel management is the opposite of hospitable and made me feel immediately unsafe and uncomfortableThe hotel scammed to say they have free WIFI - it is not true, you need to pay the resort fee to include your wifi. DO NOT try to speak with managers (TONY) on site, he will downgrade you to spite your reason and dispute. IT is the most childish thing I've ever encounte ",11/1/18,1
Great Hotel & great Value ! We stayed at the Row Hotel for a week. We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel location is perfect. Amazing location in the heart of Times Square. 1 block away from 9th ave! Rooms are a bit small but this didn't bother us as we were out for most of the day. Staff was super friendly. We definitely will be back next year,11/1/18,4
"Im a returning guest, its my 7th time coming now to Row. Its my go to place for when i'm in New York, perfect location and the staff are usually really helpful. It's just got everything you need. I would totally recommend the Doughnuts in City Kitchen next door to Row. They're amazing! ",10/31/18,5
"the staff at the lobby desk for check in was not very kind.The room was quite small.But more important, the room was extremely noisy. No way to sleep during the full night.I definitely recommend to avoid this hotel ",10/31/18,1
"Love this place, great location, clean, white fresh r linnen and walls, I like the window shadesand the RESTaurant wall art! The tv and internet was easy. The security was near the elevators. I like the secure elevators where you type in your floor number and then it tells you which elevator to go to. ",10/31/18,5
"Hotel was central to everything (times square, subway, bus station). We were able to walk to most places. Rooms and facilities clean and modern. Rooms warm enough, didn’t need to use heater. We got a free room upgrade. WiFi was great. Hotel security 24/7. ",10/31/18,4
"We visited for 3 nights in December 2017. We absolutely loved this hotel for its facilities and location to Times Square. Like any New York hotel the rooms are small and basic but we weren't in NYC in December to stay in the room. The downstairs area has a fantastic open plan bar and seating area which was fab to sit and people watch at any time of the day and the on site food outlets were great, especially for breakfast. I wouldn't hesitate to go back if we return to NYC ",10/31/18,5
"I loved how close and convenient it was as I was attending a conference in the Times Square area. It was easy to find and only a quick walk from Penn Station. The room was clean and comfortable, and my request for a fridge was easily accommodated. ",10/31/18,5
"The hotel is average at best. Average cleanliness, interior is aging and deteriorating. The price is excessive for what you get. However, what is the real issue is the fraud conducted by the hotel. I phoned the hotel twice from South Africa before coming, asking what the situation is with regard to accepting Amazon packages on my behalf. They told me no problem at all. I travel frequently and have had packages delivered to many hotels all around the world with no issue. However, after noticing peculiar charges on my credit card, I contacted the General Manager. He then told me I was charged $58 for accepting packages on my behalf. At absolutely no point was I made aware of this fee: not before I arrived, not when I received the packages, not when I checked out. Simply deducting fees at will from customers' credit cards is fraud, by definition. In a city with so many great options, DO NOT STAY THERE ",10/30/18,1
I would never stay here again. Apart from the location this place has nothing good to say about it. Tired and old it feels like student accommodation. Not even sound proof .The rooms are tiny and the beds very uncomfortable,10/30/18,1
"After calling the hotel twice beforehand and not being told of these fees, I was charged $58 for accepting 4 small amazon packages. This is fraud. I will be notifying booking.com and Tripadvisor as well as other sites ",10/30/18,1
"This was my first stay t the Row since it changed from the Milford Plaza. Really enjoyed my stay and would stay here again for sure.The hotel has been modernized and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The concierge is great and always willing to help.I had the breakfast package and the baked goods were yummy ad fresh daily. It would have been nice though to have it changed up a bit though from pastry type items.The location of the Row is fantastic as it is close to Times Square, the Theater District, the subway and for those who like to walk its within walking distance to Central Park. Also close to lots of restaurants on 8th and 9th ave.No need to look anywhere else. Will stay here again next time ",10/30/18,4
"On our return to New York our cruise ship was delayed so at the last minute, not able to make our late night flight home,needed accommodation in NY. We paid $330.00 US for a Queen bed at the Row after trying a few others. Another hotel recommended them so we lucked out! Being a Saturday night and weekend before Halloween things were very booked up. Great location walk to Times Square and close to Cruise ship Terminal but will pay $ in Taxi depending on supply/demand and NY was hopping! Cool vibe in lobby area very losers and clean. Huge eatery on opposite side of reception. Our cost included a Continental Breakfast of coffee/tea, apple or orange juice, piece of fruit-banana,orange or apple, fresh bakery item- croissant, bagel, toast, various other pastries with butter, jam, cream cheese available. Additional bigger breakfast for more $ at eatery mentioned earlier. Seating available and friendly helpful staff /servers. Queen room on 12th was pretty small but bed was comfy and clean crips sheets felt great! A/C wasn’t working so called down and immediate response from maintenance. Ended up opening window and lulled to sleep by the sounds of NY lol! Too tired to care! Waived our resort fee because of our short overnight stay and stored our luggage for free until going to airport for our late night flight so we could enjoy the day in NY before heading to the airport. Very helpful with directions and check out with reception staff. When we picked up our bags we were escorted out to arranged taxi! Security keeps an eye on things if you’re standing around for too long. Thank you for helping us out when delays happened! The Row made our extended NY stay very pleasant ",10/30/18,4
"This hotel is in a very good localisation and the rooms are cleans. The staff is really nice, they accepted to change our room because the fisrt one was too small. The hairdryer didnt work anymore and they brought to us another only 15min later. We had a really good stay at the row hotel. Thank you ",10/30/18,4
"I typically stay at the Soho Grand, Beakman, or Michaelangelo but the prices were so much better for the Row and since my business trip was in mainly in the theatre district The Row seemed idea. The second I checked in, I knew I made a huge mistake. Unfriendly front desk. Got to my room - a USED ear plug next to the bed, an open used lotion bottle with lotion on the carpet, dust everywhere, dark marks that looked like burn marks on the curtain. I went down and politely complained, housekeeping came up and did a subpar job (removed the used ear plug, left the lotion bottle). But the real horror was when i tried to draw myself a bath and the water was BROWN. I took pictures and emailed to GM and took picture to front desk. The aloof front desk guy “apologized” and gave me a refund for one night’s facility fee - a whopping thirty dollars. I booked through hotels.com and their customer service was excellent. They called for me and got the run around , even deceived into thinking they were in touch with a manager when indeed they were not. The next day a housekeeping manager came to my room to check on it and possibly move me to a new room for my last night. I was getting ready and asked for her to come back in 30Minutes. When I got back that night, housekeeping hadn’t even come into my room. I can not say ONE SINGLE POSITIVE thing about this hotel other then how close it is to all of the broadway theatres. Avoid this place at all costs. I don’t want a comped room. I want a refund. This stay was disgusting and unpleasant. ",10/30/18,1
"Dirty, worn up hotel/rooms. Not worth the money. Photos on webpage taken with panoramic view; in real life rooms are much more smaller than they look on photos. Lobby modern and nice looking. Rooms terrible. Dirty and even mold in the bathroom. Far away from 4 star rating ",10/30/18,1
"Excellent location, My family was super happy ,is closed to the time square. good restaurant around too.I will be back in the summer.Is nice restaurant inside at hotelThey have house keeping everyda ",10/30/18,5
Excellent location for exploring new york. excellent access to all transport needs. room of standard new york size. Excellent wifi connection. Would return no problem. Will recommend to frienda and famil,10/30/18,5
"I stayed at this hotel for 2 days on a business trip and honestly it will be my last time staying at this hotel when I do come and visit nyc. The manager I believe his name is John, he works overnight is a jacka** very unprofessional and I couldn’t believe row nyc had such a douche as a manager. Never again ! ",10/29/18,1
Hotel is busy with guests checking in all hours of the day. Hallway is dim. No coffee making facilities in room. You need to walk down the hallway to get your cold/hot water. You would expect at least bottles of mineral water to be provided for the price you pay. No coffee making facilities in room. Once you have checked in there is no further contact with any hotel staff as the access to the rooms is away from the front desk. You do not get any sense of warmth and hospitality,10/29/18,2
"The first room I got was so noisy because it was closed to the elevator...I asked for a new one and only after one night I got a new one, actually very good with the view.I thought that everything was solved... unfortunately the third day I can not have a shower in the morning because the water was cold, so I had to wash my self with cold water to be presentable to the business meetings... that’s not acceptable for the price of the hotel... the compensation was 75 dollars, is it enough?? ",10/29/18,2
"This hotel is easy to get to, friendly, and has access to good food. The room was quiet and clean. The staff was friendly and we would return to stay again. As an ""older"" couple, we still felt comfortable in this modern space ",10/29/18,5
Great hotel. Great value. Great experience. Perfect location. Great deals. I highly suggest booking the ROW NYC. Exceptional service. The entire staff from the front desk to all of the teams was a very pleasant experience.,10/29/18,5
"Had a 5 day 4 night stay at Row NYC......really nice hotel with friendly and very helpful staff. Great location perfect for everything. First room was not very nice but row was happy to move us to better ròom, no complaints ",10/29/18,4
"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel. The first time was so good that I decided to return again with my daughter. We had originally booked a superior double room, but we had the option to upgrade to a 'deluxe' room for a modest additional cost which we took advantage of. The additional benefit of the deluxe room was the city views and the views certainly did not disappoint. However, I would argue that the room was very tired, cramped and certainly not deluxe! I would go further and say not 'superior' just basic. The carpet was dirty and had an iron scorch marked into the fabric from previous occupants.Our room was on the 10th floor looking over 8th Avenue, so the traffic noise was difficult to contend with. The room is not sound-proofed so you have to quickly adjust to sleeping against the sirens and continual horns of the taxis. The Italian family in the adjoining room were equally as loud! But this is New York, the city that never sleeps, so neither did we! But saying all of this I would still be tempted to return to this hotel again - primarily for the location and the cool hotel vibe ",10/29/18,4
"The hotel check in and out was a breeze, the housekeeping were helpful. The Wifi was spotty but can’t help that. Noise does travel from outside from the corridor and the doors echo slamming so sleeping aids helped. Overall location perfect and had no problems. ",10/29/18,4
"Great location. Rooms are very small but clean.The staff is good.At first we got a room with small sized beds, so my legs were out of the bed. They insisted that all beds are one size. It took us some discussions until the manager agreed to come with us to our room and only then agreed to move us to another room at no extra charg ",10/29/18,3
I’ve been here a few times. There’s always a bad feeling of over rated. But this time I ‘am leaving a message. the room was not clean at all. The walls where so thin we could here neighbors whisper in there room and they hallway. The bathroom is so tiny you have to move the toilet paper out of the way to sit on toilet. Nicely located. Trendy place. Way to expensive.,10/28/18,2
Small and dirty rooms! The hot water was unavailable the first day so I had to take a cold shower! I intended to stay there for 5 nights but changed to another hotel on the second night die to the reasons mentioned above,10/28/18,1
"An affordable hotel with all the right amenities. Amazing location in the heart of Times Square. 1 block away from 9th ave! Amazing AC, Amazing Beds, Amazing Views, Amazing Coffee and Pastries from Baltazar! I had an easy Check in, with detailed information and maps provided to the surrounding area. 24hr gift shop (in case you need water or forget your charger like me). ",10/28/18,5
"Nice and clean hotel, perfect place to be in New York. If you are there for a holiday it is a good startingpoint of your day. Rooms are smal but niceThe food was oke and the service at the bar is goo ",10/28/18,4
Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at The Row. Definitely a great place to stay. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The only thing I found to be a bit “disagreeable” was the laundry charges...very expensive.,10/27/18,4
"Stayed for a full week. Rooms are good, small as all in NYC. Location is perfect, few blocks from Times Square and 1 block of Port Authority.To visit the City and get a comfortable room works. Elevators are always full and you need to wait a few minutes. For me it is not a problem but is really frequent.The worst is Checkin, which is realy slow. Summart: great location, good room. You get what you pay ",10/27/18,3
"Arrived at the Row after a two and half hour taxi ride from JFK airport, all yellow cabs have a policy of fix fee to and from the airport, we speedily checked in and was instantly upgraded, wow we thought, and a completely drink at the hotel bar, beer crap!!! moving on, June an I was wondering what our room would have been like had the hotel had not have upgraded, the room was 2720 , 27 floor room 20 great view at the rear of the hotel and view of Times Square through the high rise buildings, the rooms are a good size, bathroom a bit tight, but things on closer inspection are very grubby, gunge stuck to the wheels on chair in the room, and hair stuck to June’s cable of her curling tongues every-time it touched the floor,? the room we think was in need of a update in our opinion, and a very deep clean, in all the cost was $1558, fantastic location but would I recommend! NO! Shop around, one other thing NY is an amazing place, on earth xxx ",10/27/18,2
"Also using last year, I was staying for the second time. It's a convenient location to go anywhere, so I like it very much! Breakfast was delicious, and the staff was friendly.I would like to stay at this hotel again ",10/27/18,4
"Best area, great service, second year staying. I have recommended to other family members and they will be staying in the near future. Will not stay anywhere else on all of my future trips to NYC. Thank you guys ",10/26/18,5
"Stayed there as part of a promotion through Wyndham time share (this was our lodging provided... this is not a time share nor a Wyndham). We had a nice time. Around the corner from 42nd St Times Square subway entrance. They gave us a corner room with king bed ($40 per night upgrade but worth it). We slept well. Comfy bed and double shades that kept light and sound out. Adjacent to City Kitchen, a great food court with Latin, Mediterranean, Coffee/Donuts, Lobster Rolls, Sushi, Burgers, etc. I was happy with prices and selection. District M has pizza 1pm til midnight (?). Ours was super good! Only disappointment... $60 ""Facilities fee"" for two nights (maybe $30/night?) covers wifi access, business center, fitness center. This seems excessive for what we didn't use. Close to several Broadway shows, incl Frozen ",10/26/18,4
"When offering coupon packages the hotel should be in sink with the offers and know how to help guests when having problems. For the breakfast, adding a couple more staff would make the line go faster. But overall it was ok. ",10/26/18,4
I've stayed at this hotel many times over the last few years. I select this because of it's great location (just off Times Square) on 8th Avenue and value. Accommodation is a bit cramped and the internal décor is not the best but hey! who cares - you don't spend much time in your room when visiting NYC do you!!! I will stay there again and highly recommend this hotel.,10/26/18,4
I have stayed here a few times and the hotel has improved each time. Everything is very efficient. Easy check-in and out via email. Rooms very clean and water bottles and water stations provided which was a bonus. I would definitely stay here again,10/25/18,5
"I really appreciated to be so close to Time Square and 5th avenue. But when I went to take my key (late but I've sent a mail in advance), my superior room was given to someone else and I had to wait 1h to get a normal room.The room was vey noisy (there was a door between mine and neighboors one) and I could hear them as they were present in the room ",10/25/18,3
"A centrally located hotel with clean rooms. We had breakfast on site and was very satisfied with the selection. The rooms are tight, but we spent most of the time exploring. Would definitely stay again. The bell men, always got us a taxi as soon as we asked. Thanks for a great weeken ",10/25/18,5
"We had a great stay at Row Hotel and their lounge District M. Everything was wonderfull, from check in to check out. breakfast was great and the staff very friendly. night time pizza and cocktails were great too and Zak, Jose, Ubib and Carlo were fantastic  ",10/25/18,5
"We arrived in the afternoon, and the first thing we were told, was that our room (Deluxe room with city view) was unavailable, and we would be downgraded and get some compensation. As we said this was unacceptable and not okay, the receptionist told us the room was actually better than the Deluxe room with a city view, and we would get a mini fridge for free. We decided to take the room to avoid further discussions. Neither of us has ever tried living in a room that small. We had nowhere to put our clothes, as the room was not accommodated with a closet, and there was nowhere to put our suitcase except the floor right in front of the bathroom. The following day, we decided that we would call the reception to explain our situation, but unfortunately, the phone at the room did not work (Just like the other plugs by the TV), and as there was nobody in the reception at the specific time, we decided to ignore it. Generally, the cleaning at the hotel was at a very low standard, and the maid service at our room was very impolite when I told them about the cleaning. Our bathroom was okay, except for the bath which was full of mold, due to the bathroom not being cleaned ",10/25/18,2
"Good hotel if you're looking for a central location. Very close to Times Square and the Theatre District. Clean but small room and bathroom. Great if you are only planning to spend a short amount of time in the room. Internet works and is fast, no issues. Overall, happy with my stay and would stay here again ",10/25/18,4
"Had a reasonable stay at the ROW but may not stay there again as it is getting dated in the many floors which the rooms are on. The foyer gives it a sharp look but when you get to your floor, it was drab and the lights were set to low. The room was OK however the shower curtain didn't stop the water from going all over the floor ",10/24/18,4
"I can honestly say that staying at this hotel RUINED my vacation to NYC. First of all, I booked a QUEEN STANDARD room to stay for two nights, and when I asked to verify if the bed was queen, the associate told me that it was. Check in isn't until 4PM, so when my friend and I came back to the hotel around that time to check in, I was shocked to see a FULL-sized bed in our room (plus the room was so dirty-- but more on that later.) When we went down for assistance, the manager told us that we had booked their ""cheapest standard room"" and that they don't guarantee a queen sized bed. I argued that I specifically booked a QUEEN STANDARD, and that I even double checked with an another associate earlier to avoid this mess. The manager just shrugged and insisted that the hotel was completely booked and that she can't change our room. At this point, I was livid. There is NO way two adults can fit into a FULL sized mattress, especially considering the $300/night we were paying. After we insisted on a refund, the manager informed us that she will check with someone else to help resolve our situation. A few minutes later she comes back saying ""it's meant to be"" and that she JUST received a cancellation on a double room. At this point, I was getting pretty desperate so I just took the card key to the new room and hoped that this nightmare was over. WRONG. When we stepped into our new room, my friend and I were met with an overwhelming smell that was similar to that of a SOUR MILK. It was to the point where I thought that someone had literally peed on the carpet. My friend and I didn't want to make another complaint, so we decided to air the room to see if it gets any better. After over an hour of keeping the window open, we realized the smell was still lingering. We also noticed a huge wet spot on the carpet (hence my speculation that it was urine.) At this point, I was beyond disgusted. On top of that, the room was so dirty, I even found someone's false eyelashes on the side corner of the bed. I felt like all the germs that existed in this world were in that room. I decided to call housekeeping to ask them to see where this smell was coming from. This guy comes in way later, and tells us that he is sick and that he can't smell anything from his nose. WTF. He then brings a air freshener and sprays the whole room right before the manager comes in to check it out. She shrugs again and says that she does not smell anything (WELL DUH. YOUR EMPLOYEE JUST SPRAYED THE WHOLE BOTTLE OF AIR FRESHENER.) However, she did say that while my friend and I were out, she was gonna have someone clean the carpets, which I hoped will get rid of the smell. WRONG. When my friend and I came back to the room a couple of hours later, the smell was still there, carpet was still dirty, the room was, as always, filthy. I was just getting so tired of complaining over and over, so we just decided to sleep it off. I woke up feeling so dirty, even after I took a shower, but we were only staying there for two nights so we decided to spend most of our time OUTSIDE the hotel and only went in to SLEEP and SHOWER.I hate to say it, but this hotel completely ruined NYC for me. I was so happy to leave the hotel and the city when it was finally time to go. Even going down to the elevators to check out, I took a good look at the hotel, and again, I was shocked by how dirty it was. I caught a glimpse of the maid ""cleaning"" a vacant room, and I swear she was just walking around in it. I am pretty sure they don't even vacuum the floors. They just change the toiletries and make the bed. Disgusting. FYI, remember that the hotel rate listed is NOT the final price. After a ""maintenance,"" ""facility fee,"" and a bunch of taxes, prepare to pay at least $90 MORE per night than what you paid for. WILL NOT BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN. THIS HOTEL STILL HAUNTS ME IN MY DREAMS ",10/24/18,1
"I really liked this hotel, especially in comparison to recent New York stays. It's very convenient, friendly staff, quick in and out valet parking available (but pricey...but worth it). Walking distance to pretty much everything  ",10/24/18,5
"Having stayed at the Milford Plaza and then the ROW numerous times over the years (it has always been a go to for us), I was extremely disappointed in our 5 night stay this go around. We found roaches in our room and was basically ignored by the staff. Twice hotel security knocked on our door and accused us of smoking marijuana, which made us laugh, however, the security person was rude about it. Rest assured there was no smoking of anything in our room ",10/24/18,2
"The room and bathroom was small but was fine for the purpose. The bed was comfortable and the decor and atmosphere of the room and hotel was fitting for NY. Oddly the outlets didn't work well, our phones would quit charging through the night or the hair dryer would quit mid dry, it was weird but overall I would definitely choose to stay here again ",10/24/18,4
It was great stay. The room was Clean and the staff was friendly. The single room I had was small but comfortable. Modern and functional. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Lots of decent and cheap food just blocks away. Shake Shack....,10/24/18,4
"Super location just off Times Square. Easy walk to everything. The room was very small, even by NYC standards. Basically just a bed and barely enough space to move around it. Bathroom size and layout were absurd. I actually had to sit sideways on the toilet to use it. Housekeeping was good, but room carpet was old and badly burned. Wouldn’t stay again. Poor value relative to other hotels I’ve stayed in near there. ",10/24/18,2
"I would recommend staying at this hotel for its location to times square/broadway/a subway station (we walked most places) however be aware that the rooms are quite small (which is fine if like us you plan on only sleeping there) and make sure you ask for a room away from the elevators. We were very lucky on check in to get Junior who informed us that he was going to get an upgrade as the room we had booked was not great unfortunately for us however we could not move until the 2nd night of our stay. He was correct with his statement about the first room being 'not great' - it was terrible! We were put in 933 which is right next to the elevators which are extremely noisy and the room and bathroom were ridiculously small, the room had also not been dusted in quite some time and just did not feel clean at all - I have since let the hotel know I feel these rooms should not be rented out at the rates they are asking if at all... Our second room 2053 however was much better - we had a nice view out over the buildings to the Hudson river, it was much larger and the room was actually clean. The last 3 nights of our stay were pleasant and I would stay in the hotel again if we had a room like this. If we had not been informed before seeing our first room that we were definitely being moved on our second night I would have put a complaint into management about the standard of our first room straight away. ",10/23/18,3
"It is advertised as a modern hotel but in reality it is very old with bad smell and expensive, the employees treat badly the guests except for the bell boys (for the tips) they charge an extra fee to the agreed price for the ""facilities"" (USED OR NOT) without warning when making the check in of 30 dollars per day and they charge it to your credit card without the right to claim at your check out so I ENDED UP PAYING LIKE THE MARRIOT MARQUIS THAT IS ON THE CORNER NEAR TIME SQUAR ",10/23/18,2
"Before booking, I read a lot of mixed reviews, the most common negative being the small rooms and the hotel needing a bit of TLC. When you go to New York, you literally need a base camp to sleep and wash in, so we weren’t precious about having a big room or fancy facilities. HOWEVER; The room was so small we had to turn sideways to walk around the bed, the wardrobe was no bigger than a school locker, and the carpet (all 3 square ft of it...) was filthy. The lobby and restaurant are very clean and modern, but the other disappointment was the reception staff. I cannot express how rude they were. As we arrived at the desk, the receptionist yawned so loudly as we were giving our details that we had to repeat them when she was done. She was sighing the whole time and tapped her fingers on the desk impatiently while my partner got his ID out his wallet. She told us our room wasn’t ready, which was fine, so we asked where we could leave our bags. Another big sigh. She told us to go back down the steps to the left, and we’ll see the guest who had checked in before us, we should just follow her! We thanked her and asked when our room would be ready and she said all in one breath “I don’t know next!” At which point the guest behind us was called up to check in. The guys handling luggage for the hotel were fantastic, they had obviously got the memo that manners and a smile cost nothing, which their colleague was clearly yet to receive. When we returned later, a different member of staff on the reception desk was once again very rude. He sighed at the two questions we asked and and told us there was a line waiting behind us. Not impressed at all. But the location is great for Midtown and there are larger rooms available. ",10/23/18,2
"Great hotel, very modern - the bar served really good cocktails and amazing pizza. The rooms was very good and kept pretty clean throughout our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel if your looking for a NYC holiday ",10/23/18,4
"I spent 5 days in New York and stayed in Row NYC hotel which I booked directly from the hotel website. You get additional benefits by booking directly from its website such as coupons and discounts in outlets. Hotel was in a very good location inside timesquare. Food in the restaurants are pretty good too and there is security which checks for people taking the lifts during the evening, so pretty reassures you. Overall good experience and nice time in N ",10/23/18,4
"This hotel is grimy and in dire need of an overhaul. Everything smelled of cigarettes and had a film on it. Wish I had a Naked Gun body condom to sleep in that bed. The room had absolutely zero noise-proofing, you could hear everything happening in the adjacent rooms and hallway ",10/22/18,1
It was not a pleasant time. you can't paint over a nasty wall and expect the room to look good. I did like the view but everything else was horrible. I do not recomend this experience to anyone. they mixed up my reservation and I ended up paying 800 dollars for 2 nights,10/22/18,1
Row is conveniently located steps away from most of the Broadway theaters and provides for an easy access to both entertainment and eateries. Rooms are spacious per NYC standards and bedding is comfortable. Downstairs canteen offers good breakfast options on a budget,10/22/18,4
We checked in Oct 14th and Latonya at the front desk was very professional and a real joy. I was able to check in early and she was so helpful. The lobby bar is amazing and the staff so fun. I was helped the next day with Christina S. at the front desk another excellent employee. She helped with all my questions and gave many suggestions with laughs and smiles- Both Latonya & Christina and the lobby bar staff made this stay awesome. (good breakfast at the lobby bar). We will be back thanks to these 2 ladies from the front desk,10/22/18,5
"Location was great, hotel design is cool, front desk guys friendly, online response was quick and efficient and generally the site staff was very helpful with all my family members requests.The in site food options are a helpful option for quick meals, was kinda overpriced but for NY it was ok. This hotel is in the middle of all the Times Sq/ broadway action, so expect a VERY VERY BUSY lobby and long waits for the elevators. The downside of everything started to happen when we checked in and started discovering the place. I was kind of disappointed about the cleanness and the low maintenance some of the areas have. Lobby Restrooms was always dirty, hallways carpets are really dirty and smelly and the shower was very moldy at the time we got in to our room. Room was Ok, but VERY noisy at night. I could hear everything was happening on the street! I think for the price we had a good deal location wise. But definitely when talking about cleanness and hotel look, the online pictures are a little bit misleading compared to reality, the hotel really needs to improve their maintenance standards, especially in such a busy spot ",10/22/18,3
"As far as location goes, the Row is in the heart of the action. However once you get beyond the nice lobby, the room was tiny and dirty. There was thick dust lining the headboards and tile ledge in the bathroom. The dust between the bed and the wall was disgusting. The room smelled like a damp basement. And there wasn’t a coffee maker which made mornings less than convenient. I would never stay here again. ",10/22/18,2
"Excellent location right beside Times Square and theatres for Frozen and Anastasia. The hotel is excellent, with great views. The bed is extremely comfortable and no noise heard in the rooms. The wifi is excellent also. ",10/22/18,5
I only stayed one night at this hotel but my experience was very nice. The room was very cleaned and the views were quite nice. The situation is very close to Times Square and the street is very populated at every time. Very recommendable... I would come back to this hotel in the future!,10/22/18,4
"Row Hotel has a location that is hard to beat, next to Everything! The rooms are OK but not top quality, the rooms are clean but not immaculate, the staff is friendly but impersonal, you have to pay for service you not always need, the beds are good but not top quality, weith all that said...it´s not a bad blace to stay while in NYC ",10/22/18,4
"This hotel is in a good location if you are touring NYC, but it is so outdated it and dingy. They charge an additional fee for services like water, gym and internet. This is paid upon arrival and in addition to the room rate. Water dispenser broken in every floor but 1. The noise from the elevator on the other side of my room was so loud I couldn’t sleep at all. ",10/21/18,2
"good location in times squire, near a lot of broadway theatresbut pricy and I was charged for facilities that I didn't use. the room was small and not very impressive with regards to the price the staff not friendly ",10/21/18,3
"For the last 5 trips I've made to NYC I have stayed at The Row. Couldn't recommend it higher, the rooms are good (for NYC), and comfortable. It's in a fantastic location for Time Square and close to all the tourist stuff you could want to do ",10/21/18,5
"Room was small, about the size of a cruise ship room, very clean, internet was great. Furniture could use an upgrade, very low to ground- I felt like a giant and I’m 5’6”. One half of the fake drapes were just missing. Hallways were dimly lit and some of the murals were scary- even to me. For a female solo traveler, this was a little unsettling. However, staff was nice and the location is great. Elevators rocked- took you right to your floor cluster ",10/21/18,4
"This hotel was perfectly situated for theater, Times Square, most other mid-town attractions. the room was somewhat minimalist, but clean with a comfortable bed. Not enough storage in the bathroom-no shelves there. Staff was helpful ",10/21/18,4
"great location, near to subway and bus terminal, to teathers and Times Square.. The personal are very nice, so clean, was perfect experience, free wifi, and souvenir's store very cute, disccount in food, i enjoy this experience, amaziong vacations at row nyc. I would like booking again in my next trip to new york. ",10/20/18,5

Right in down town and within minutes walking distance from major point of interest. Staff very friendly and able to do everything they can to make an enjoyable stay. Lobby and elevators are a little bit tired as well as some bathrooms. This was my third stay and in the previous two stay I also was upgraded to a Junior Suite and to a Suite with renouvated bathrooms. Will stay there again on my next sta,10/20/18,3
"Slamming of doors from other guests really disturbing. Tiny bathroom with no place to place your big luggage except on the floor. Phone in the room was not working, security guard came knocking on the door like you have committed a crime! Unfriendly reception staff members, unapproachable attitude that you would wonder if any one free to take your request, key didn't work the second day as if it was your fault.My company chose the hotel, otherwise I wouldn't stay there ",10/19/18,1
"Check in was quick and went smoothly, to use the lifts you need to put in your floor number which seems to work well. Room was quite small but clean, storage was adequate ,air conditioning was noisy couldn't have it going through the night as it kept us awake. No tea or coffee making facilities which we knew beforehand ,but you could get water and ice on select floors. In the room you had a iron, ironing board, safe and hairdryer, the towels were changed daily and there were complementary toiletriesin the bathroom. Location was perfect in the heart of the City. There was a bar but prices were a bit steep, upstairs a variety of places to eat and you got a discount from staying in the Hotel. We learnt our lesson after the first night eating out our bill for 8 of us two course meal no drinks over $300, so after that we went to 9th,10th or 11th avenue to eat and drink. We found that everything was very expensive $13 for a glass of wine, but you could find a bar with a Happy Hour. Before we went we brought a New York Pass for 5 attractions at £102@ which was worth every penny and I strongly recommend, one of the attractions we done was on its own $64. We done everything we had on our list absolutely shattered after the 5 days but worth every step. Can highly recommend Hop on Hop Off Bus, 9/11 Memorial & Museum, The Rockefeller Centre, Empire State Building and for the best views of Statue of Liberty the New York Water Taxi as part of the Pass. For free attractions try Central Park, Central station, Time Square, Walk across Brooklyn Bridge which is definitely worth it.We were told to visit Scotty's Diner 336, Lexington Avenue doesn't look much from outside but don't be put off by appearances, staff very friendly and the breakfast's divine , we went there two days running. Pancakes, waffles, French toast anything you could wish for and plentiful , constantly refreshing your coffee or tea .We saw the Musical Donna Summer really great show , you need to queue up in New Time Square at the ticket office from 3.00pm to get the best deals on Broadway Shows ",10/19/18,4
"ROW is a very good hotel with a very good location. It's easy to go to the subway and there are a bunch of restaurants close, cheap and expensive ones. The bed is awesome and people are very nice and helped us a lot ",10/19/18,4
"This trip was for my granddaughters 18th birthday and senior year of high school--her first trip to NYC. We chose The Row because of the location and the pricing. Our reservations were made on line; however, due to some changes we made to our reservation (because of hurricane Michael in our area) we had occasion to correspond by email with one of the reservation agents, Stephanie Solari. She was most efficient in handling our changes and very prompt doing so. She is an asset to The Row. We stayed in room 1605; had two queen comfortable beds. Bathroom amenities were nice, plentiful; room was clean; air conditioner worked great. There were three of us (my daughter, granddaughter and myself) in the room, and we have no complaints. The location is superb! We like to stay in that area--and this hotel is right around the corner from Times Square. We had croissants from District M, and the coffee is great. I had stayed here in Oct 2009 when this hotel was Milford Plaza. The Row has renovated nicely. Lots of restaurants, shops and bars within walking distance. Check in/check out was quick and easy. I will definitely stay at The Row again ",10/19/18,5
This hotel was in a fantastic location. Unfortunately cleanliness was not great in the rooms which really let it down. The staff were courteous. The bar was good. Confusing on the grades of the rooms as well with the pictures on websites.,10/19/18,3
"On the surface someone has done a great branding and marketing job on ROW NYC. Unfortunately it’s pretty, no - make that very - superficial.A trendy, Ian Schraeger-style dark entrance and bright wall coverings disguise a shoddy makeover. From the start, the wait for elevators was regularly lengthy; presumably the call system where you’re directed to a specific elevator based on the floor you enter was meant to work better.The carpets and public areas obviously look tired and in need of a clean/lick of paint despite the low lighting.It doesn’t get any better in the rooms. Chipped paint, worn carpets and frankly dirty surfaces along with the low budget refurb from whatever the place was before all make this a pretty depressing experience. And I found an assortment of discarded tissues and plastic cutlery in a drawer. Presumably not on the cleaning list.And while the air conditioning works commendably, it does so accompanied by such noise that it has to be turned off for a good night’s sleep.All this wouldn’t be so bad if it cost a sixth of the nearly $600 I stupidly paid. It’s a shame that what feels like a good idea has become so tired and poorly maintained. You should avoid if at all possible ",10/19/18,1
"I experienced a poor incoming and check-in communication; furthermore, I received no support from the staff upon my arrival, and received no communication about the services I would have been billed for.To make things worse, my guest room was dirty, since the furniture was covered with dust, and also our bathroom was unconfortable ",10/19/18,1
"Great hotel right in the middle of everything. No coffee maker in room, or fridge, but both can be requested on arrival. but they can be hard to get (we took our own coffee maker). We had trouble with noise to start with but staff were very obliging and helped us change rooms. Internal rooms are best for noise but depends on other guests of course ",10/18/18,5
"Most of the staff were rude and unwelcoming, except for Junior who provided us with great service upon check in. Rooms were outdated, small and not cleaned properly. And the A/C in the room was EXTREMELY noisy and didn’t work properly ",10/18/18,1
"Amazing location , easy access to everything we needed and fab views! Had to change rooms as first one had a cockroach running around the room! Not much fun but caught it! Got a good upgrade and was dealt with well by hotel. Good brekkie for on the go too. Would stay again only gave 3 stars due to the bugs! ",10/18/18,3
"My daughter and I spent a few days in NYC and Row NYC was recommended. It was great. The location was perfect. We could walk everywhere. Close to Times Square, theaters and close enough to walk to Central Park and Rockefeller Center. We loved the hotel. ",10/18/18,5
"Everything was great. Is all about location and it is perfect.Is near Times Square and the theatres are just around the corner.You can go anywhere just waking, for example Empire State, Madison Square Garden, the Public Library, et ",10/18/18,4
Nice no frills hotel in a fabulous location in the centre of everything. Rooms are nice but the bathrooms are small and the bar shuts very early. Staff were friendly. Watch out for the facilities fee of $35 per night that they charge you on check out,10/17/18,4
The hotel was conveniently located to an event I was attending at the Javitz Center. We were able to walk to and from the event and hotel. This helped saved on travel costs. Continental breakfast was included as well,10/17/18,4
"ROW NYC is a no frills, modern hotel in a fabulous location at a great price. Don't come here for glamour, but you'll get more than you pay for. Staff is friendly, rooms are clean. The hallways are dark, which is meant to be modern but I get the feeling it's to hide something, like shortcuts on the renovation. ",10/16/18,5
"Stayed yet another time at the Row. And another great stay. Like all of NYC rooms, they are small, but clean and so convenient to everything. A nice place to stay with nice staff. And the location is great. ",10/16/18,5
The location is excellent. Nellie and Zach at the front desk were helpful. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. Our group felt safe in the neighborhood surrounding the hotel as we went to shows or walked around Times Square. We'll be back,10/16/18,4
The water and ice machines apparently are under construction on most floors. Touting water available but then making guests hunt for it wasn’t very nice. The view was spectacular and the room was clean. Bedding was itchy but expected for the reasonable price,10/16/18,4
Stayed here for my 40th birthday staff went out there way to upgrade rooms me and my family were staying in and also to get us all on same floor Hotel was in great location only round corner from main part of Times Square Staff were friendly and helpful,10/16/18,5
"It was modern, clean, room was spacious, staff might be available to help you. Be resourceful and make sure you look around to find the amenities. On site bar was also the the breakfast bar in the morning. I wish it was included in the price...it was a little expensive...you can just go across the street for a cheaper breakfast ",10/15/18,3
Rest and calm amidst the Times Square chaos. Staff was exceptional. Clean room with beautiful views. Lounge and hallways relaxing. Filtered water and toiletries were indicative of knowing the needs of the guests,10/15/18,4
"People is clover around, the hotel does not have reconstruction since 3 decades ago. The beds are good and the bathroom too, the outside looks like a very bad smell environment. Low lights, a bit scary. They charge to you for a service of ""facilities"" like pool and gym and you have to pay them even if you do not use it ",10/15/18,3
I am giving you a very low review because the guest room and the elevator were beyond dirty. I had asked the cleaning lady to come and clean the room and it took her less than 1 minute to clean it. It was so dirty I cannot really find the words. I paid 286 dollars a night plus taxes and I believe the cleanliness did not justify the room. I was in room 1829. My name is Jeannette Collazo. Feel free to call me if you need more info.,10/15/18,1
"The staff at this hotel went above and beyond to ensure my stay with them was a positive one. The hotel was clean, comfortable, and overall a beautiful place to stay. The location is incredible and the price unbelievable for what the offer. This will likely be my go-to stay next time I'm in the city ",10/15/18,5
"Excellent location in 8th Avenue, closed to Broadway and Times Square and 10 minutes away from the Central Park. The services provided were good, the staff was very friendly. Internet could be better on speed ",10/15/18,5
"The service was poor, staff wasn't helpful, especially if you travel from Canada because they don't understand the difference between Canadian and US dollar. I wouldn't stay there again because it was low value for $300US per night ",10/14/18,2
Very basic hotel for US standards. Found flase nails and dust under the bed whilst trying to find a lost shoe. Food hall attached to the hotel useful for breakfast Very good location especially for broadway show,10/14/18,3
"My partner and I have recently returned from a disappointing 3 night stay at Row NYC and will not be returning.We booked the hotel room based on the reasonable price and photo’s on Row NYC’s website but were very disappointed to find how run down the room was in comparison. When we checked in we were informed we had received a room upgrade so we didn’t like to imagine what our original room was like. Our room was un-clean. Their was thick dust around the skirting, a yellow smear on the side table (which could have been a stain) and food stains on the TV channel menu. Our main concern was that we both got bitten in the night whilst in bed. This happened on both the second and third night of our stay, so the bed linen must have contained some sort of bugs. This lead to us both having a poor sleep because our bites were itchy.The bathroom was more run down than the room and very compact. The toilet seat was positioned too close to the wall, not allowing enough leg room when sat on it which was uncomfortable. The bathroom didn’t contain a flannel so I bought my own to use. The next morning we found the Housekeeper had taken my own flannel, and replaced the bathroom with their own flannels. On our third and final morning we were left without any flannels again, and I could not use my own as this had been taken.A positive note for the hotel is that its in a great location as it’s only a 5 minute walk away from Times Square. The air conditioning was fully functional in our room which kept it at a pleasant temperature throughout the day and night. Our room was positioned opposite the elevators, but we didn’t get any noise disruption from these.We were charged a facility fee of approximately $30 per night which we feel we didn’t get the use out of because we didn’t require most of the facilities included. The one facility we did use was the WIFI but at times this was slow and didn’t always connect. We were however grateful that we were only charged the facility fee for 3 nights instead of 4 because we checked out one day earlier than originally planned. This was kindly arranged by the hotel staff at the reception desk who were very helpful. Please note we didn’t raise our room concerns with the hotel reception because our stay was so short, we made the most of each day and spend minimal time in the room just to sleep. Upon checkout we were in a rush to get to the airport and didn’t have time to detail these concerns. ",10/14/18,2
"I slept 1 night, Had to wait 30 mins to checkingThe room was very dirty. I founded BLOOD on the bed cover and had to call the housekeeper by my self cuz the managment staff didnt care. The buthtub was dirty. Went to talk with manager(tim) but nothing big, the took off only the facility fee(45 out of 220 ",10/14/18,2
"Best place, and location, good service at reception and bars, good restaurants at city kitchen, we needed to change the room because it was dirty.By my opinion the hotel just has to improve cleaning rooms and bathroom ",10/14/18,4
"loved this place. me and my mate stayed here from the 8th until the 11th of October 2018. Everywhere was spotless. We were allocated room 1048 which was on floor ten with a side view. Our room was huge with a nice big bathroom. The beds were really comfortable, I would fall asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow every night. Can't comment on food but there is a nice café over the road from the hotel which I think is called Mammas Food Court, I recommend it there. The location could be better as midtown isn't the best of areas, shall we say, trash on the streets, people smoking weed, bad smells, but the amazing Time Sq is still near. Hotel was fab. Will be back ",10/13/18,5
"This was a really great hotel. It is in walking distance to everything. A block from Times Square and Broadway. We walked to Macy's, Rockefeller Center, Central Park. The rooms were clean as was the hotel. They had some great places to eat on the premises. Prices were good at the restaurants on site as well. Staff was very helpful. If I go back to New York I would definitely stay here. ",10/13/18,5
Pathetic cleaning of the room. Did not changed the bed sheet for three days inspite of having food stains on it. Just changed the toiletries and thats all. Rooms are really small. There is heavy noise of air conditioner which makes it difficult to sleep.The staff is really rude. I called the operator and asked for scissor to cut a zip tie and the lady hanged the phone by saying they do not have one. Never going to stay in this property again. No reason to stay here until you do not have any other option,10/12/18,1
"After staying with family in Brooklyn for a few days, we moved to the hotel to be closer to museums and the theatre for about 4 days. The location of this hotel was good but condition of room was more than disappointing. We expected a small room but not the loud noise level in it from the AC unit nor the very strong musty smell that was always present. Of course we had not planned to spend much time at the hotel with so much to do every day, but even though we were only in the room from later in tbe evening until morning we couldn’t wait to check out. We had paid for a room with a city view and while it was noted on the booking that was only if any were available, it almost added insult to injury when we faced into the back of the hotel and noise and smell were problematic. ",10/12/18,2
"After previously staying here in 2014 we decided to go back for a second stay at the Row NYC. Since 2014 they seem to have brought in a resort fee which pays for things like wifi, a refillable water bottle and the use of the business centre. I'm pretty sure the wifi and business centre were free last time (I know they were) so I have no idea how they actually justify this $34 a night charge. I believe with a bit of research (read that as a simple google check) it's easy to see they are avoiding the occupancy tax they would need to pay to the city if the room rate was higher. Anyway, the staff at reception were not particularly friendly and upon check in we were given a different room than we had booked, again. After checking with the happy happy reception man that we had been given a particular room type (ADA) we were informed that our room had been changed to a regular room. I informed him that the room had been booked as an ADA room and that was the room we needed. They had no ADA rooms available although this was the room that we had booked. When I explained that we needed the room for a medical reason he scuttled away and spoke to someone else before mysteriously finding the room we booked was available after all. Amazing.The room itself was great, all the things you would expect were there including the refillable water bottles. The water point to fill these bottles was on the 8th floor mixed in amongst the rooms and the water tasted disgusting. Guess who bought bottled water for the entire trip (5 nights) instead of using what was supposedly included in the $34 (insert eyeroll here). The room was either stupidly hot or freezing with the air-con because the temperature adjustment didn't seem to work. The air-con is NOISY. The safe within the room was locked when we got there, a phone call to the concierge seemed to be wasted but guest services got this sorted very quickly.The wifi was okay, not quite enough to stream netflix but it worked for most things. Room was clean and the housekeeping staff were all very pleasant. Good location but I doubt we'll stay here again ",10/12/18,4
Row NYC Hotel is a good choice of hotel to stay in NYC. Excellently located within walking distance to many attractions. Very close to Times Square and Port Authority Bus Terminal. Very safe area. Good value for money taking into consideration NYC prices,10/12/18,4
"The only good thing is that the hotel is in an excellent location.Too longer story to tell however, our original room was 12ft sq, dirty and had a whole in the bath/shower which my husband nearly fell through! New room we were given was already occupied when we entered with the key, very embarrassing for us and them. Third room was OK however still dirty, the electric blinds didn't work and the shower taps were hanging off the wall. Very poor customer service from front desk. We wouldn't recommend sadly ",10/12/18,2
"PLEASE PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BOOK THIS HOTEL!!! Let me start by saying that I am definitely not picky with hotels - I often prefer a dated motel with self catering than swanky modern places! We booked this hotel based on the pleasing photos online. Yes it looked basic, but was in an excellent location so seemed perfect. When we arrived the concierge apologised immediately that we were by the elevator shaft. We saw no issue with this, but he insisted that he take of the local resort fee for the room that night (approx $30). Of course, we were shocked, and just thought of it as good customer service. However, on arriving at the room, we soon understood why. Our ""double"" room was a single bed, one small bedside table and a window looking directly into another room.And then...An elevator went past.The only way I can explain the racket is something akin to a train passing through a station it is not stopping at accompanied by nails down a chalkboard. At full volume. Every 20 seconds.We proceeded down to the receptionist to ask if there was a possibility of upgrading or moving room, but were told the hotel was already overbooked by 6 rooms. We were, however offered earplugs. We went back to the room with these and huddled into the single bed to try and sleep but the foam earplugs did little to drain out the noise and noting to stop the room shaking every time somebody used the elevator.In the end my husband and I took the decision to go to a different hotel for our week in New York. The hotel were very sympathetic, with one employee saying ""I wouldn't recommend staying here.""We did get a refund, but wasted hours of our time in the greatest city in the world moving hotel and trying to get refunded. Don't be caught out like we were - for just a $100 more there are much better options in NY ",10/11/18,1
"We Checked into this hotel for a 4 night couples break to New York. The staff at check in were very friendly and the check in queue was very short. The lobby area was spotless and there was a lovely fresh clean smell which was there every time you entered the lobby. The room was a little on the small side but was ideal for a 4 night break to this great city. The room was clean and the air conditioning worked great. The TV had a great selection of channels and the FREE WiFi was very very quick and worked very well. Overall great location 2 minute walk from Times Square, Would definitely recommend this hotel for all the right reasons. Thanks to all staff for making our stay so great. Will be Back ",10/11/18,5
The location is perfect to be in the heart of the Theatre District. Staff is friendly and helpful. Rooms were tight and clean. I have stayed at this hotel three previous times and I will stay there again,10/11/18,4
"Hotel is ridiculous. First they gave me a room which A/C was not working. Second they charge you a fee for internet, gym... what???? Why they dont include on the daily rate if you must pay? Ridiculous Finally, if you will buy something at Amazon, you will pay USD 10 per package. I felt robbed at this hotel and do not recommend it ",10/11/18,1
"The hotel has a good location, the rooms are very small, the bathroom is to small. At my stay - very long check-in times, too lang - more than 45 minutes. Staff were very friendly and helpful. So ok - but not more ",10/10/18,3
"This was our 4th and final stay at ROW! We first stayed at Row just after it changed from the Milford plaza and it was great, the staff where so kind and helpful, the rooms had just been decorated and there where no rip off resort fees! The WiFi was free and anything else you paid for as you needed it IE calls which in 2018 you don’t need everyone has mobiles. Now 4 years later this hotel has drastically went downhill, issues that I have addressed directly with the hotel now. It is sad to see. Check in staff are rude, the hotel only has a small area in the lobby to relax and it’s often closed for events. The rooms are dirty and falling apart. There is mold around the bath, toilet is black the skirting and doorstop had fallen off, blinds where broke, tv remote did not work, drawers where broke and kept opening air con unit was filled with items that had fallen in. Our 3rd visit was bad and we decided to give the hotel one last chance due to location. Sadly this will be our final ever stay ",10/10/18,2
The hotel is in a fantastic location right next to times square rooms are tidy and clean bar staff are very friendly but the rest of the staff are terrible. I had my sunglasses stolen from my room and when I told staff of this they could not have cared less done absolutely nothing to deal with the problem found this very disappointing,10/10/18,3
"Dark spaces, does not work the electricity connection in the batroom, bad customer attention at the front desk, not water to drink, poor service, collect more for the same room when they offer a different room ",10/10/18,2
Stayed early October hotel is just 5mins. from times square. Room was very comfy and spotless. would stay again for sure all the staff we met were very helpful and friendly. We have stayed here before and was not disappointed. WiFi was goo,10/10/18,5
"A good hotel for a stay in NY. Good value (by NY Standards), clean and comfortable. We paid extra for a city view room, which was well worth it. Room looked out over the town to the Hudson River. There is a bar, and a food court with a fair range of stuff. However, loads of restaurants are in the same area. Broadway is only a block away! ",10/10/18,5
"Best location ever. Worst room ever. The condition of the hotel was not good. The hotel was tiny as compared with the website reference. And the bathroom was 2x2. They were fairly clean, but way too small. ",10/9/18,3
"I came to new york with high expectations as you would it's probably one of the most visited cities in the world. I have been here before and stayed in a different hotel. Big mistake I should of re booked where I went initially. This hotel looks great in and around the lobby but this is where it ends. The room looked dated and grubby with mildew around our bath. They appear to focus on the initial view and amenities of the hotel but this is where it ends. There are some great eateries attached to the hotel which are great to dine in. The location is good but it depends how much impact a nice room has on your holiday. I can see plenty of negative reviews for the hotel and these seem to outweigh the good comments. The management replies appear to be lip service, if you truly respect the comments of your guests do something to bring your rooms up to standard with the rest of the hotel. I won't be returning in fact after a five day stay in washington DC I have returned to NY but not to the ROW ",10/9/18,3
"Great location, near the theaters and restaurants. A bit dark hallways which seem run down and dirty. Rooms are clean & need updating. Staff is goods done front desk helped me get a nicer room. It's good if you need a comfortable room ",10/9/18,4
"Glad to have checked out this hotel, but a room with 2 queen beds leaves very little floor space to walk around. Tight quarters but great location for downtown meetings. beds were comfortable, modern, clean, and decent shower ",10/9/18,4
The staff was very professional. Our visit was just for one night. The hotel is in a great part of town. We did find the room and hallways to be very dirty. The bathroom is extremely small. Many of the outlets did not work. We will not be staying here again.,10/9/18,2
We loved the size of our room and it was very clean and the staff helpful.The location was great with plenty of places to eat close by. Subway very close Would have liked tea making facilities in the room,10/9/18,5
"This is a trendy hotel in a great location in NYC. While the rooms were nice, they were quite small, and could use a little touching up. The staff is great, and while a little on the pricey side, not a bad place to stay ",10/9/18,4
"The location was great, close the Times Square. Required high facility charge, but the WiFi quality is bad and water dispenser was broken. There is no refrigerator in the room and inconvenient for take any drink or food back to the hotel. ",10/8/18,2
"Online check in and avoid the lines. Rooms small but clean and tidy. Perfect for families and midtown visit, located in the middle of everything, you won’t regret staying here. Shake Shake just in front and Junior’s restaurant around the corner.The lifts work perfectly (just need to be cleaned more often). Subway is everywhere and you can reach any spot in Manhattan easily. Stayed here since Milford Plaza times and will continue ",10/7/18,5
"excellent hotel, staff very helpful and friendly, times square just round the corner, housekeeping very good, would definitely stay there again was able to leave luggage until later within walking distance to empire state building and 5th avenu ",10/7/18,5
Check in was awful. 4 employees but only one front desk worker helping a long line of people. Took 40 minutes tip check in. Put us in a handicapped room for no reason. The room was ridiculously sparse in its decoration. The only positives were the continental breakfast and the location. Will not return.,10/7/18,1
"I enjoyed my stay. The staff was very courteous and friendly. The feel was very European due to the large quantity of foreign guests, particularly Spanish speaking clients. The lobby had a very comfortable feel ",10/6/18,5
Great location definitely budget quality. Staff is friendly and helpful. Lobby area nice and smells good. Rooms remind me of ikea. Our room was clean but smelled of urine and there were cockroaches in the hallway.,10/6/18,3
"Came to NY for business. Traveled all night, walked comic con and asked for an early check in. When the clerk asked if I wanted a room without a view, I said “I’ll wait”. She then told another patron I had an attitude. Rude. ",10/6/18,2
"We passed at Row NYC just one night. The room was clean and very beautiful, with a nice view: thanks to Junior from the front desk for giving us this amazing room at a very good price! Great deal!!!! ",10/6/18,5
"On first impressions from the website this hotel seemed to be ok. As my trip was over a long weekend I wasn’t too fussed about where I stayed. I’ve stayed near Times Square before I won’t be staying that close again. The location is ideal if you literally want to be in the hustle and bustle of New York City, shops and attractions. I wasn’t impressed with the room at all. Everything about it felt unclean. From the lift, to the hallways to the rooms this hotel just needs to be updated. 90% of the hotels I’ve stayed in have been 4/5*resorts so maybe I’m used to the rooms being extremely clean. When travelling to New York expect the rooms to be very small and priced competitively as there are so many hotels ",10/6/18,3
"The staff is nice and helpful. We stayed 7 nights on the 21st floor. We never had to wait long for the lifts. The hotel is very centrally located and close to the subway station. The rooms are rather small and equipped only with the necessary. An iron was available, a hair dryer we searched in vain. In the corridor gave a free drinking water dispenser. The restaurant located in the hotel ""My kitchen"" has a good selection and reasonably priced. Theaters and Time Square are very close. For dinner there are good restaurants in the area ",10/6/18,3
"It's my second time in this hotel. Very disappointed from the room. Very little room and bath, the air conditioning is not working, impossible noise from the air conditioning system outside the room even when it's not working. The noise from the other rooms is impossible ",10/5/18,3
I have stayed at Row NYC on four separate occasions. Two have been with groups I’ve led. The staff is professional and extremely accommodating. The M Bar is a great place to have a before or after dinner drink and the City Kitchen is convenient and tasty,10/5/18,5
"I was here for two nights and I can’t tell you anything good or decent about the hotel except the location- The entrance is so smelly and dirty, the elevators are dilapidated and make so much noise that it almost felt like they were going to break. The lobby to the rooms was so dingy, dirty and smelly. Room barely had any amenities - not even a basic electric kettle for water. The bathroom floor was dirty and the walls were so full of dust. The tv remote was loaded with dust too. Seemed like no one used it forever. I called twice to request for one and was screamed at the first time and the second time they said they were going to send one in the room but it never arrived. And yes!! They do their best to avoid any contact at checkout so that they don’t have to hear our complaints- I’ve stayed in nyc atleast 15 times now but never in such a bad hotel. ",10/5/18,1
Extremely expensive for what you get. Unbelievably small rooms. No kettle in the rooms and you don’t even get one upon a request. Rude staff. Dirty passages etc. The elevators are ancient too. Bad experience,10/5/18,1
"This hotel is so busy at the front desk to attend to its guests that are already inside the room. We were booked for 4 nights and needed slippers, but after trying a hundredth time, our request remained unheeded ",10/4/18,2
"After reading some of the other 'amazing' reviews I must say I felt like I stayed at a different hotel!! The only 'great' thing about this hotel is the location. After a nightmare with the transfers we finally arrived at the hotel exhausted. We then proceeded to reception and was met by a very rude receptionist!! She was more interested in talking to other members of staff than greeting us. This was my first time to the big apple so I expected big things and we were really excited to get to the room as we had a table booked for diner.As soon as I opened the door I was extremely underwhelmed with our 'premium city view room'. The rooms are not 'city chic' or 'sophisticated' as the website states more like 'cramped' and 'dull'. You couldn't see any city views at all, I was absolutely gutted not just with the view but the room in general it was filthy! Let's just say I was extremely disappointed. I called reception to ask if it had even been cleaned? And requested that it was cleaned properly. The bathroom smelt like urine. The reception said that a cleaner would come and take care of it which they did to some degree. After 2 uncomfortable nights we realised that the air conditioning unit was not working and it was pumping out hot air making the room unbearable. I was reluctant to ring reception on a second occasion but after the money spent on the hotel and another 3 nights there was no way we could endure it. Maintenance said that we need to be moved as they were unable to fix it. So we packed up and were moved to another room if you could call it that. I felt like I was Harry Potter in a cupboard under the stairs I don't know why we paid for a premium city view because we didn't see it! We didn't even get an option to express our displeasures as the hotel automatically take your balance payment from the card your reserve the booking with so make sure if you have any complaints make sure you voice them immediately. This was booked for special 30th & 40th Birthday's treat and I am still really disappointed that we spent our hard earned money at this hotel. I would not recommend this hotel and won't be returning!! p.s clean the windows and doors on the entrance its not appealing to new arriving guests full of sticky finger marks it's gross ",10/4/18,1
"We are currently in the hotel at the moment, we have been moved once due to a loud noisy air con until even when turned off, complained and was upgraded rooms, got to this room and ran the bath and as you can see this is the water i have never stayed in such a bad place as this. When we were moving rooms we phone the front desk to see what we were to do, the lady on the front desk replied with “do exactly what they told you to do last night” then she hung up the phone! Its just very poo ",10/4/18,1
Exceptional hotel in all respects to customer service  I will definitely stay here again. Loved everyone there from check in to bartender to breakfast service. Room was amazing value. I only wish I could stay longer!,10/3/18,5
"We have stayed at this hotel before and we love it for its proximity to Times Square, Theaters, subway and all NYC has to offer. Yes, the rooms are small but we only use it to sleep (beds very comfy). Lots of restaurants in the area. Continental Breakfast was included in this stay. Breakfast consists of a piece of fruit, hard boiled egg, pastry, coffee and juice. No seconds. Check in was easy as well as check out. We arrived at 10 am and room was not available until 4 pm. Hotel will hold your luggage (for free) so you can explore the city. The same on our departure day. We checked out at noon and returned at 6 pm to retrieve our luggage before heading to the airport for a late flight. A reminder that this hotel has a facility fee of $34/night plus 4 more taxes so the price you see if not the final price you pay. Review your reservation before you pay online. All in all a great place to stay near major attractions ",10/3/18,4
"I was coming into the city for one night for a concert and wanted a centrally located hotel that was clean and comfortable. Took a chance and Row had a perfect location, and we were upgraded to a room with a fantastic view ",10/3/18,4
"We love the location, so close to everything. The room was small but very comfortable. The most important thing for us is the BED !! Was extremely clean and super comfortable. And the plus of the room we have a big window facing part of TimeSquare. ",10/3/18,5
"please do not book the breakfast online, in fact have breakfast outside the hotel every single day. the quantity is not sufficient to be termed as a decent breakfast. check in is tiresome. Check-out is pretty smooth. ",10/3/18,4
"I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The location is perfect next to Times Square. Furthermore the staff was very friendly and the hotel has everything I needed. I need to make special mention of the indoor food court, very handy and great food ",10/3/18,5
"We enjoyed staying at the Hotel, it was ideally situated near Times Square and the theatres on Broadway. Hotel was lovely and staff were friendly. Rooms were a little small and dated but they were clean and freshly made beds/towels daily so no complaints ",10/3/18,4
"The hotel is really great, it has a great location, the room was very nice and clean and the staff was very friendly. There is nothing more to say I definitely recommend it we enjoyed our stay a lot : ",10/2/18,5
"Traditional style hotel sat right on front:let us check in early,also had breakfast,also got 2 seafront view rooms when asked as we were only booked to get one, thankyou for making our stay a nice one ",10/2/18,4
"I booked this hotel using Frequent Flier miles. I received an email confirmation stating that all fees and taxes had been paid. I arrived at the hotel and was told that there would be an additional ""Resort Fee"" tacked onto my bill. This place is not a resort. It's a passably decent New York hotel. I showed them the email confirmation that said all fees had been paid. They told me that ""everyone who walks through that door is charged this fee."" This fee is a scam that would be illegal in almost any country in the world except the United States. They will tell you that the ""Resort Fee"" allows them to provide a water bottle, wifi, and phone calls. It's BS. I don't need a water bottle, and I didn't make any phone calls, and even the Comfort Inn provides free wifi. This stupid, fraudulent fee colored the rest of the stay. There are plenty of hotels in New York. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere the management doesn't bend you over the front desk and vigorously insert their resort fee ",10/2/18,1
"Nice hotel since it was ""The Milford Plaza""- Well located, nice renovation, rooms kind of small, but it's normal in NYC. The Staff at the breakfast are not friendly, in fact they are intolerant with the guest, specially with those guest with kids ",10/2/18,4
t ROW Hotel you made our stay in the city very enjoyable. The hotel is in an excellent location to explore the city and the cleanliness of the rooms were exceptional. The beds were very comfortable which helped in getting a good nights sleep after an exhausting day of sight seeing. Thanks to all the staff and keep up the good work.,10/2/18,5
I am very surprised at other reviews for this hotel as our stay was excellent. We had to make a last minute reservation for 9/30/18 as the hotel we had booked was horrible. The rate for this hotel was not bad considering the location and the last minute booking. Th staff was extremely helpful and friendly from the front door to bell hops that held our bags for us on the day of checkout. The room was small but that is to be expected in NYC. It was clean and comfortable. I would absolutely stay at the hotel again,10/2/18,5
"Horrible place to stay, very dirty bathroom , front desk useful , carpet in the room is very dirty and old. First need to training the front desk to be more polite and efficient.And need to wash the carpet ",10/1/18,1
"This hotel didn't really hit the spot! Having stayed in a variety of hotels in New York over recent years, I expected more for my money.On arrival we were met with a very long queue to check in, and a very officious front desk clerk, who made a great show of reorganising the queue and moving people around when he should have been making more effort to get the increasingly agitated customers checked in. Having finally got our keys we were then faced with the most ridiculous lift system I have ever come across in a hotel. You have to punch in the number of your floor into a keypad on the wall, which then indicates which of the seven lifts you should go to to access your floor. My colleague and I were on different floors, and this system meant that we could not travel up in the same lift. If I needed to go to my colleagues room (floor 17) I had to go back down to the ground floor (from floor 11) and repunch the floor number to go back up to 17 - absolutely ridiculous! The bar area is nice, and serves great pizzas; the wine and the service was really good. The other meal option on offer is City Kitchen, offering a variety of different cuisines, a bit like a shopping centre food court. The one meal we ate here (breakfast) was very tasty, but I really object to having to eat any meal in a hotel off a cardboard plate, with plastic knives and forks (in today's climate of necessary plastic use reduction), and drink my coffee from a paper cup.The rooms were serviceable, and spotlessly clean, but very small, with absolutely tiny bathrooms. The furniture does not really fit the tiny space, and the air conditioning is so loud that it was impossible to sleep with it running. Overall, this is an extremely busy, noisy hotel, but it is in a good location for uptown and Times Square. However, it really isn't for me. There are many other, and in my opinion, much better places to stay in New York, in a similar price bracket ",10/1/18,3
"Besides the location, this hotel is expensive, dirty and is not worth the money. Rooms, elevators smell bad and the crew is rude. The AC of the room I was didn't work properly. Spend your money in another hotel ",10/1/18,1
"I booked the ROW NYC Hotel on behalf of a colleague - she gave good feedback and would recommend it if I was ever to book for anyone else. The room was clean, great value and in an excellent location. ",10/1/18,4
"Great location. This is a great hotel . I found it was good value for money . Could not be better. Small room but neat tidy and well equipped, No appropriate clost in the room only shelf space and dresser drawers ",10/1/18,5
"The Concierge service in the Hotel Lobby is my main complaint. The Concierge desk is adjacent to the Check in Desk and appears to Guests and gives the impression that it is integral to the Hotel. It is reasonable to assume that the people working there are Employees of the Hotel. Simply I was ""ripped off"" by the Concierge who recommended a sightseeing tour that cost me an additional $108 more than it should have done. When I complained, having discovered a more suitable and cheaper option that was not offered to me, which actually fitted my specification of the type of sightseeing trip I wanted, it soon became apparent that the Concierge service is outsourced to another Company. This Company is paid commission to promote sightseeing packages. The Concierge Company refused to accept any responsibility and duty of care and disappointingly so did the Hotel. Ironically the staff who were Employees of the hotel were most helpful with regards other aspects of our stay, so this appalling mark I have given is entirely due to people who apparently have no contractual obligation to the Hotel or their guests. It is their actions that have been the source of my intense dissatisfaction. I chose to book my sightseeing trip in the hotel to avoid being scammed by a street Vendor and trusted the Hotel to ensure this did not happen. I feel very badly let down ",10/1/18,2
My friend and I had a lovely 2 night stay at Row NYC. The room was small but comfortable although I was disappointed in the lack of tea/ coffee making facilities in the room. Not being familiar with city prices I thought they were high for what you got. The location however is perfect,9/30/18,4
"We love New York City, and would be very glad to come back - some time. But my age are now79, so I'm not sure if I will be able to do this trip again. But I will not be surpriced if I (we) will show up again ",9/30/18,4
"Great location. This is a great hotel if you are here for musicals/ Broadway. Could not be better. Small additions would help. Ex. More wall hooks for towels , clothes in a small room to compensate for lack of shelf space and dresser drawers. ",9/30/18,4
"Great location, tiny room, well-worn. Booking agency would not refund our previous, unused, reservation - that hurt. We are retired and have to watch our money. For $350 for one night, that was a lot of money! ",9/30/18,2
"Great hotel location. It is almost right in the center of the city. You can walk to almost any where. Very friendly staff and very comfortable beds. However, make sure your reservation is cleared with the front desk staff to avoid confusion and frustration. ",9/30/18,5
"Nice location, near the subway, 24hours hotel, easy access to broadway shows. Although the rooms are very tiny it is comfortable, have potable water in the location and nice restaurants ! Would stay in it again  ",9/29/18,3
"Excellent position for a short stay in NYC. Very close to Times Square and a walkable distance to many attractions, Central Park, Empire States Building, Central Station etc. However we were disappointed there were no coffee making facilities and pretty patchy WiFi. The most annoying thing was being stung for an extra 34.42$ a night 'facility charge'. Not very impressive ",9/29/18,4
"My friend and I met in NYC for a week's vacation and we chose this hotel from a web site. It exceedd our expectations with cleanliness, comfort of beds and quality of service from the reception staff and housekeeping staff. It was central for all we needed to see and do - we were being ""typical tourists"", and we found getting around by walking and the subway easy and practical ",9/29/18,5
"When you need just a clean room with a good internet function and easy in and out procedures at somehow central position, this might be a good place for you when the price is right. I see the limit around US$ 160.00/night. The rooms are clean, but really very small ",9/28/18,4
I will never stay here again. One of the worst experience at such a high price. I wont recommend it o any one for sure. The room was simply dirty and old and no one really cares because the location is good,9/28/18,1
"We stayed at the row last October, really liked the hotel and staff, the room was nothing fancy but extremely well located just off broadwy, close to everything. the bar off the lobby was fantastic with live entertainment very exceptional musicians and a fine vocalist spent a night ther ",9/28/18,5
Planning to comeback soon and would like to have healthier option at the Kitchen. More choice in Coffee type too.The security was great. Please could my return amount be refunded as soon as possible,9/28/18,5
"Staff simply got an attitude of “ I don’t care”. I know now that the price I paid was only for the location of the hotel, nothing else. At the end, I did find a solution for all the challenges I faced, but only because I decided not to accept their poor customer service attitud ",9/27/18,1
Spent four days and three nights there. Friendly staff. Convenient location. Great amenities. Would definitely stay again. Great price also. Used the gym and adequete equipment. Stayed in a corner superior room on the ninth floor and had no issues,9/27/18,5
"Hotel is located one min away from Times Square that is very convenient. Check-in and check-out experience was super easy using online app. The room was very small, but for a night stay it didn’t make any sense for us. ",9/27/18,4
"Perfect location and very close to Times Square, bars and restaurants. The hotel is very modern and is impeccably clean. Housekeeping did a great job in cleaning our room. Prices for rooms are quite steep but maybe that's just New York. ",9/27/18,4
"First off, this is not a 4 star hotel its more like a 2 star hotel. This hotel is really run down and gross, i have stayed here before for business but it wasn't this bad. The carpet in the hallways smelled like sh? t along with the elevators and lobby. It literally smelled like sewage & sh? t throughout the entire hotel. I had a friend meet me in the lobby who lives in NY and she was utterly disgusted by the smell of the hotel which was embarrassing to say the least. Now lets talk about what was supposed to be one of the best rooms Deluxe or whatever, the room had mold and mildew all through the bathroom very drafty and dirty. i literally got sick after staying in there for 3 nights breathing in the mold and mildew. i came home with sinus infection from staying there last week. The floors was dirty in the bathroom I had to lay down towels to avoid putting my feet anywhere. To sum it up GROSS, GROSS and MORE GROSS... won't be staying there again or recommending anyone from my company again. The location is good that why i gave it 1 star, but not worth the stay or money ",9/26/18,1
"It was okay, but I'd expect more. Stayed here last year the same time and it seemed much better. Room was really small (but that's NYC) but the bathroom shower leaked all over the floor. #2530. Just seemed very worn and outdated. Staff was very friendly though ",9/26/18,3
Overall hotel needs an upgrade. Location good. Noisy A/C so couldn't keep it on at night. Staff at front desk very unhelpful. Close to times square and subway. Rooms are small but to be expected in NY.,9/26/18,2
We got an amazing deal for a room with an incredible view. The free breakfast was perfect and everyone workig at the hotel was so nice and helpful. We were so happy with our stay and will definitely return,9/25/18,5
"dirty room, especially the bathroom had dirt from many former guestseven after a complaint to the reception the room was not cleaned bettervery thin doors, noise in the hallway is very good to hear and wakes up in the middle of the nigh ",9/25/18,2
"The location of this hotel is super. It's not a fancy place, it's basically just rooms, and they're small. No atmosphere, although it's busy. The staff do their job and don't smile much. It's expensive so I probably wouldn't stay again. But it's a couple of blocks from the Port Authority, a short walk to the awesome little Bryant Park and Times Square. And a great breakfast place called Green Symphony is a block away ",9/25/18,3
The hotel is in a great position to visit New York. Comfy beds. Great variety of food choices. Room was close to noisy lifts and had a very loud air conditioner. Great spot close to all Times Square has to offer.,9/24/18,4
"The Row is a great place to stay near Times Square. The rooms are tight as all NYC hotels tend to be but comfortable. It’s a short walk to food, shows & all the kitsch you could want. Hop On/Off buses board nearby, subway is handy as are taxis. ",9/24/18,4
"it has good location, staff are very nice. wifi is really good. city view is nice but is noisy at night if you sleep early. They have offers with Stay Wanderful company. just love the deals.In general it is good to try i ",9/24/18,3
The room was very well kept and the hotel is located in the middle of everything. Very easy to get in and out of room quickly. The room was cleaned every day and I always felt safe when inside of the hotel.,9/24/18,5
"the hotel ROW have very good location and have various elevator , the way to room is very fast, near to Times Square and near have rstaurants, teathres, stores is very comfortable and the employees are very friendl ",9/24/18,5
I like the convenience of being near Times Square and the availability to cabs. My only wish is that they would lighten up the hallways. They are too gloomy for me...I dislike the black ceilings and lack of sufficient artificial light. The rooms themselves are bright and well-lighted,9/24/18,4
Perfect locationReasonable price with the locationGreat 'food truck' style restaurantComfortable rooms with space to store your luggageTo Improve: Would have liked a fridge in the roomAllow guests to take glasses from the bar to roo,9/24/18,4
"My partner and I absolutely loved the location of this hotel. However our rooms were the size of a shoebox and our bathroom a 1/4 of that. Being right in/near Times Square it can be really noisy, but we felt safe being able to walk around with hundreds of people whatever the time of day or night. We loved District M (food complex) and that there was a little deli if you needed water/snacks. Pros: Perfect location, close to 5th Avenue (amazing shopping!!! ), lots of restaurants and cafes, super close to broadway and helpful concierge who helped us organise our tickets to The Lion King. Cons: The size of the room and bathroom was super disappointing as well as the price of the resort fee. This hotel isn't bad for a couple of nights, but as we stayed 10 we would have definitely preferred something a lot more spacious ",9/23/18,3
"Satisfied Visitor who will stay at the Row again ! Very close to the Broadway shows and great restaurants! I enjoyed eating at the District M especially, the donut and coffee shop! There was easy access to your room with all the specific elevators going to the specific floors ",9/23/18,5
"Stayed at this hotel on a school trip. This is one of the worst places I have ever stayed! The front desk could care less if they help you. The hotel itself is scary to say the least! My son & I got off the elevator stepped out into the long, dark, smelly hallway & looked at each other & said we felt like we were in an American Horror Story ( Hotel Cortez) episode! Rooms were so small you had to crawl over 1 bed to get to the other, & put your luggage in the bathroom! Let’s mention the tiny bathroom, you can barely move in,& your lucky if you have a shower curtain! Some of the kids on this trip was crying their rooms were so bad! Horrible rooms & staff ",9/23/18,1
"Very dirty, mold in the bathroom ceiling. Doors paint are old and getting off. Bed is broken. I slept there on a fashion week and they charged $500 a night!!! No matter how hard is it to get a room in this week it is outrageous to charge this amount for this kind of rooms. Delux. ",9/23/18,1
"good location, easy access to subway, within walking distance to times square, shows and many good restaurants. room a little smaller than expected but still good, staff friendly and helpful, would definitely stay here agai ",9/23/18,4
"This trendy-looking hotel fails to deliver on many fronts; rooms so small the bed barely fits, a bathroom so small that there may only be a foot between toilet and sink, rude front desk staff that don't even pretend to care, insufficient attention to details (e.g. 4 hours after requesting foam pillows, a second call was necessary), and a check in that approaches dinner time....for a mere $270/night. Never agai ",9/22/18,2
"It's the second year I stay at the ROW NYC, the location is excellent. You have theatres right around the corner. Time Square one block away and the sightseeing buses 2 or 4 blocks away (it depends on the company you like most). Elevators are fast, considering all the guests they have, you never wait more than a minute or 2 to get into one. The staff is nice, and the concierge is really helpful. If you want a big room, maybe this is not the right hotel, rooms are right for sleeping. I think they have bigger rooms. Free WiFi ",9/22/18,5
"Only good thing about this Hotel is the location in midtown. The place needs renovating. While you are staying at at 250$ a night, they send you offers for less than 100$ a night, the reception staff is unfriendly, the rooms are not really clean, the clientele is rather bad, (puke and worse inside the elevators), the additional fee of 40$ a night for WiFi etc. ridiculous. Breakfast a bad jok ",9/22/18,2
"Booked standard room for the two people and had to be asked to be moved after one sleepless night. They didnt argue and moved us to a much better room. The standard was so small we couldnt cope and it was so nousy drom the rooms aircon so we switched it off. However because the room was on the side sort of down an alley way the nouse from all the other aircons could be heard it was like trying to sleep on a very nousy plane. The new room was much better and bigger and had adifferent view so we could leave the window open a little without the need for aircon on. It was still noisy but hey thats New York. !Food in the hotel for breakfast is ok for something quick but i wouls suggest Juniors round the corner it was fab and filled you up for hours. Hotel room at the Row has comfy beds but no coffee / beverages. TV worked and was a good size. Rooms cleaned daily with cleaners starting early so if you want to have a lie in put do not disturb on your door. They give you a water thing to fill up but you have to hunt down the water station to fill it as it might not be on your floor. All in all the ROW is central to everything and we found it a very convienient place to stay to go out and sightsee and for theaters , shopping etc. I would recommend but dont go for standard room book a more upgraded room  ",9/21/18,3
My room was not ready at check in and I had to wait 8 hours to get in. The front desk staff had obviously been dealing with some issue all day and made it very obvious they did not care that we were annoyed or inconvenienced. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!,9/21/18,1
Mohammed is smiling as we check in. He welcome us with very nice approach. He show us directions to places we wanna go. He is helpful and informative and made our stay easier and comfortable. Very warm and at home,9/21/18,5
Stayed here for a last minute conference. The lobby is nice and the free waters were a nice touch. The rooms were dorm-like and small. The bathroom was even smaller. The cycle studio and blowout bar downstairs are nice to have. Wouldn't stay here again but it's probably a good budget option,9/21/18,3
We got to the hotel after over 20 hours of flying and they told us that they are upgrading our room to “premium” and it will take an hour. We got our ‘upgrade’ only to find out that the upgrade was our original room we we already paid for. It seemed our room wasn’t ready and they made an excuse for us to wait. The staff were very rude and didn’t explain much to you and looked at you like you were an idiot just for asking a question. They were unprofessional talking about lunch breaks and time off to each other while we were left waiting.,9/20/18,3
Location is great. Subway across the street. Times Square 2 blocks. Rooms are always clean. Good value for NYC. Easy check-in and express check-out. I have stayed there numerous times and always had a good experience.,9/20/18,4
"I was stranded in New York due to hurricane Florence.I could not fly out until the 17th of September.I had booked into the Doubletree by Hilton at Newark Liberty International for one night on the 12th as I was orginally due to fly to Charleston the next day.As I was now going to have to stay in New York for 4 nights I thought I would get a hotel in the centre of Manhattan.I booked through Hotels.com and chose the Row Hotel because of its good reviews and facilities.The total cost of a single room with city view was $1004.00.The room I got,number 2635 was in my opinion sub standard and not worth anywhere near the money charged.It is badly in need of a makeover.It looks very worn and tired.The grouting in the bathroom was badly marked with mildew and the blinds were not very clean.I understand the rooms in this hotel will have a lot of traffic,but this is no excuse for basically good maintenance.I would also like to comment on the hotel bar prices.I ordered a vodka and coke from the bar and was charged $15 and 24 cents!!!!!! I understand hotel prices can be expensive,but come on this is daylight robbery. Overall I found this hotel to be very much overrated and would certainly not stay there again ",9/20/18,2
"More lighting in the hallways. Better staff screening. One bartender was excellent, one other preoccupied with trying to get female guest attention and the only female was distant, unapproachable and didn’t really care about the guest. it’s my experience that guest can look past almost anything negative if they are treated exceptionally well. In your case, the most interaction with the guest would be at the bar. You can’t change the Window size and making the rooms larger would be a challenge, but great service is something you can change immediately. Bartenders should be courteous and social. One should not stand out , so much more then the others. Pizza I ordered was good and location is perfect. ",9/20/18,1
"Everything about this place was perfect. It was modern, stylish and great in every way. Everything was perfect in the room and the bar made amazing cocktails. We were on our honeymoon and the gentleman that checked us in gave us a few drinks on the house. Very sweet. ",9/19/18,5
"poor clean, front desk rude. elevator smell to urine. location is good. all looks old. if you go with your family try to get other options. the money spent do not justify hotel cost. the location is not the best one also ",9/19/18,2
"I will definitely come back to RowNYC again. We literally walked around the corner to see Phantom of the Opera. Mean Girls was only about a 15 minute walk. The craziness of Times Square is just a short stroll way. The rooms are clean, the A/C works fine, what more could you ask for? Oh and there's a great restaurant and bar below. Ok, well the rooms could be a little bigger, but this is Manhattan, so it's what I expected ",9/19/18,4
The Row was a great hotel and the location was perfect. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The food and bar had lots of options for everyone. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting an awesome stay in NY.,9/19/18,5
"I previously stayed at this hotel and was unsure whether I would return due to room issues, however, I emailed beforehand and mentioned my concerns and was upgraded to a delux city view room with king bed and it was so much better! Upon arrival, my friends room had been left dirty but after mentioning this it was immediately sorted. I still think the hallways could be lighter as they are quite dull but apart from that we enjoyed our stay. Location wise you cannot beat this hotel and we enjoyed using the bar down in the lobby in the evenings. All staff we encountered were friendly and we would come and stay here if we visit nyc again ",9/19/18,4
"We went as a couple for 5 nights and when we got there and checked in, there's a mandatory per night facility fee which we weren't expecting, but I'm sure was in some small print. When we got to our room it was tiny and wasn't cleaned, such as the bathroom having hairs and shavings still in it as well as a pill of sorts, so we went and asked the concierge if someone could clean it, he spoke to someone on the phone (we presumed) and we waited an hour and no one came, we complained to a receptionist who was helpful and she actually spoke to someone to to it and went out to eat. When we came back it wasn't done properly as the pill was just moved and the bath only rinsed, we complained to the receptionist a final time and she got the cleaning manager to look and eventually we got a room upgrade and the facility fee waived, which was nice. This was all on the day we arrived in New York and we were already tired from the flight and didn't get settled until well into the night.The lifts seemed fine at first, but as the week went on it was obviously a flawed system, as certain lifts only go to certain floors which causes a lot of issues with overcrowding and a long wait. During our stay there was a fashion week event going on, so when we came back to the hotel it was usually packed with people in the bar for that, this was a pain more than anything as it just made the overcrowding on the first floors worse.It's located just around the corner (literally) from times square, it's walking distance from 2 subway stations and there's plenty of restaurants and things all nearby.The money you pay, you could probably get better elsewhere, especially when you factor in the facility fee. While it didn't spoil our trip, it did spoil our first night and colour our view of the hotel. Would I go back to New York? Absolutely, would I go back to the ROW? No ",9/19/18,3
It was a good experience in a hotel the AC unit was a little loud and I suggested garage panels for my wife on the floor it was never done. I was switched from a deluxe city view to a premium room with a ok view witch I was told was a upgrade,9/19/18,5
"The lobby was the only nice thing about this hotel. Don’t waste your money. When we checked in it was going great until they told us they had no water or ice on our floor and then we get to our room for our lights and outlets now working, and the maintaince guy gave US attitude. They lost the alcohol key so couldn’t he drinks one night. Overall, disappointed and won’t stay here on our next trip. ",9/18/18,3
"Staff was excellent from check in to check out, maid service and food service workers , location awesome close to Theater District, Times Square , food great, only lacked a refrigerator and a coffee pot . ",9/18/18,4
"The ROW suited us perfectly: a clean, comfortable room at a great price and in a great location. Staff were helpful and we really appreciated the luggage storage service that enabled us to keep exploring the city after we checked out in the morning before our flight later that night. Loud air conditioning and street noise made it hard to sleep at times, but not a big deal ",9/18/18,4
We got an email through the week before our stay about bidding for an upgrade. We bidded to pay an extra $10 per night and we ended up in a spacious room on 26th floor with a great view. I'd read reviews about rooms being very small but we had plenty of space although the bathroom was a bit cosy (fine though).Our AC wasn't working when we arrived but we called reception and a chap came straight up and fixed it for us. The AC is pretty noisy but effective.It's a big hotel so it does feel impersonal but when we did interact with staff everyone was helpful. Great that they have a free (though don't forget to tip!) leave your luggage service after you check out if you have a while before your flight and want to do some more exploring without your bags. Really handy to get to JFK. Port Authority Subway (with an entrance directly across from the hotel) E line to Jamaica Center (get off the one before last stop) and change for Air Train. Takes 1 hour to 1 hour 15 mins altogether and costs $7.75 dollars per person.Had read people had issues with the lifts at the hotel but the most we ever waited was a couple of mins including on a Friday and Saturday night.If you want a value (for NY as most prices are jaw-dropping) hotel in the theatre district right round the corner from Times Square I would recommend RowNYC. If you want a hotel with a more personal feel in a less touristy area I would look somewhere else,9/18/18,5
"The location is perfect, the staff are very friendly and there are some very convenient facilities like printing, free water, gym in case you have the time, but the rooms are very small and the bathroom in our room was tiny so it was a bit uncomfortable being a family of four.

"A nice hotel... cheaper than the other hotels located in midtown Manhattan. Its conveniently located since its near alot of resto, broadways shows and time square. A good place to stay for tourists. Room is clean and spacious but the toilet is quite small.. ",9/18/18,4
"I stayed at the Row hotel for 3 nights, from Sunday 9th Sept to 12th Sept 2018. Considering I paid more than £500 for a 3 nights stay, I received the worst quality room, the room was supposed to be a queen size but it was a small double room. The room had poor ventilation, after showering the room would smell damp. The air conditioning did not work properly.I paid a $103 hotel fee for facilities and did not need or use, however it was mandatory.I 100% do not recommend this hotel at all, you would be better off at the Hilton Garden, down the block or something, then staying at this hotel ",9/18/18,1
"You have to pay a facilities fee on top of the tax. The lobby is nice includes a cafe, bar a sweet shop etc. These are all available just around the corner as location of hotel is Times Square so having these in lobby pointless. The room is a shoe box. The bathroom has no fan. The bathroom door didn’t close properly. It looked like it had been painted by a toddler. The bed was 2 put together not a double bed. There is no fridge in room. There is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. I appreciate this is in a good location but for £250 a night I expected a lot more. Plenty of hotels nearby to choose fro ",9/18/18,2
I just stayed two nights. When I get to the hotel was checked in by letonia the receptionist who told that I need to give deposit I said ok cool of 250cash plus I need to pay extra 35 per night I paid and I asked letonia for recib she gave to me..last night in order to not have issue at the check out I saw letonia and asked her about my deposit of 250usd she said at the time you check out I'm going to receive it. And check out took me around 20 minutes and charge me twice and didn't give my money complete... They as a hotel are stealing so be careful at the time you pick this place to stay it's horrible situation.. And also was in bed and around 1 hour near my room like 2am in the morning alarm ringin don't know from where but it was really noisy and unconftable,9/18/18,1
"This is a hotel which I've used three times on NYC trips; it's clean, the staff are helpful and it's handy for Times Square and all of the major attractions as well as all the local food and drink places. I'll definitely go again ",9/18/18,4
"This hotel will fool you! The lobby is gorgeous, they even had a DJ spinning. We go up to our room and are shocked. The room is literal box with the bed on a platform. There are used condoms on the floor behind the bed (dropped my phone back there). The bathroom was extremely dated, small and didn’t leave you feeling clean. It didn’t match the pictures at all. ",9/17/18,1
if you are a business traveler do not stay at ROW. Clearly designed for tourists and mainly for foreign tourists. Rooms have little to offer in the way of comfort or amenities. Bathrooms are bare. The room was very clean and the staff was pleasant,9/17/18,3

Paid more than 2,000 & had a smile little room that had no view and I paid for a view to the city and I went to the front desk and to get the room I actually paid since day one I had to pay more for it!

They offer us to change the room and we went to see it and still old and smelly not that good for a 4 stars hotel i would not recommend this hotel at all!!!! The book was to pay $390 per night and was totally NOT worth it. We found another hotel for the same price that was awsome ",9/16/18,1
"Only two problems but were an issue since had very bad nights of sleep due to super noisy air conditioner and cheap windows which allowed so much street noise even though I was on 23rd floor. Staff very nice, good coffee, room was decent otherwise ",9/16/18,2
The Hotel has great location. The staff were FRIENDLY. And lots of places to eat around the hotel. The Bed was comfortable and the rooms are small but clean. Easy to get a taxi and walk at Times Square. And Broadway theaters are just around the corner,9/16/18,4
"I had the worst experience at this hotel. If i could give a negative score on service and cleanliness i would! This hotel is definitely felt like a dorm room for the foreigners. I wouldn't recommend it f you're on a business trip, they don't even have a business center where you can actually hear the other person talk. I would personally go out of my way to tell people not to stay at this hotel - THE WORST! ",9/15/18,1
"We had a 5 night stay at The Row earlier this month and really enjoyed it. It's in a great location, perfect if you are theatre lovers like we are as it is right in the theatre districtAs for the hotel, it has a very funky feel to it and looks well presented.The Room - considering this is one of the cheapest rooms we could find in the whole of new york we are very happy with our room and the facilities provided and have only had 3 issues - 1 which was the door wasn't locking when we wanted to leave the room, we rang down to reception and someone came imediately and rectified the issue. The second problem is that unless you are a very slender person it is not possible to sit on the toilet without the corner of the sink digging in to your side and you can't actually sit on it properly because of this issue (we ended up using the toilets in the lobbys on our way out and on the way back up to our room as it was just more comfortable) -obviously I can't comment on how other rooms are set upl. The 3rd issue would only effect people who are light sleepers like myself - the air conditioning unit is sooooo loud, placed right next to the bed and thanks to the heat wave of this summer it was not an option  to sleep without it on so I had to buy ear plugs and even they only quietened it a little.As for facilities we had a safe, iron and ironing board and hairdryer all provided, the room appeared clean and tidy and the sheets and towels were changed every day! (I can gurantee this happened as I had recently died my hair and had some colour transfer every night that was unavoidable but the fact the colour wasn't there when we came back everyday it confirmed everyting had been changed) again my only slight issue was how early house keeping came around. As a couple of night owls who regularly go to bed late having house keeping knocking Customer Service - apart from the above mentioned issue with the lock we didn't really have much contact with staff other than the security wanting to see our key card to access the lifts who always asked politely. We arrived at the hotel at 12ish and our room was not ready (check in not usually until 4pm) however we were given access to the lobby bathroom to freshen up and then given a pass to be able to store our luggage so we could go exploring. My only issue with check in was at no point was it confirmed how much would be put on to my credit card. From my booking email it was informed that there would be city taxes and facilities and several other things that had to be paid for on arrival however the booking just said % per night so just confirmation of what to expect would have been nice, and i also know not everyone reads the small print so it could come as a shock to some people, but she literally just took my card on check in and handed it straight back with informing me what she was doing it, also we only found out a few nights in that by showing our room card in certain places? Like city kitchen, a comedy club, the sweet store e5x we could get a discount.We didn't use any of the facilities linked to the hotel like the hair salon or gym so can't comment on those. We did go to City Kitchen and had an extremley overprices bacon roll for breakfast but i'm pretty sute these are pop ups and not directly rum by the hotel. If you looking for somewhere cheap and central and just literally for laying your head after a long day of exploring you can't go wrong with this place ",9/15/18,5
"Great location and easy to reach with train station a block Away. Staff at checking were very slow and not engaging. Rooms a good size for NYC standards. Excellent choice for the Theater lovers in the crowd,you’re in the heart of Broadway ",9/15/18,3
Great location for exploring anywhere by subway or Midtown by foot. Our room was a bit small but gave us what we needed. Staff were friendly. Hotel bar was popular and seemed to host quite a few events,9/15/18,4
I believe they have a cool vibe but the bed was uncomfortable - hotels need to get a grip on checking people in not rocket science and there is nothing worse than waiting. I didn’t try the food at the recommendation of the front desk staff - if they don’t support it it can’t be goo,9/14/18,3
"If you want an unpleasant experience in a NY hotel, book it. The staff is probably trained NOT to smile and not efficient. The elevators ''body guards'' are simply unpleasant and it takes for EVER to have an elevator. The food is so so but the room was comfy. I travel a lot for business and I find myself in NY 4 times a year and never will I go back to that hotel ",9/14/18,2
House keeping service was our only issue. They would knock on our door at 9am to clean the room but being on vacation we were not up and ready for our day. We asked several days in a row for them to come back and service the room late morning early afternoon. This was never done. One night we waited on towels for an hour and a half because 1 person was delivering requests for the entire hotel. Very inconvenient.,9/14/18,3
"If it's your first time in NYC then look no further. This hotel is the perfect starting point for sightseeing as it is walking distance to most tourist attractions in Manhattan. As it's in Time Square it is a little noisy at night (the city that never sleeps!! ), but the amenities of the hotel are worth it. Great hotel lounge/bar, access to some great food shops and restaurants without having to step foot outside, and the staff are very friendly! To top it all off, the hotel is very stylish and modern. Great value for the price. I highly recommend it and we will be coming back ",9/14/18,5
"Staff is friendly and the lobby is nice, but I wouldn’t recommend anyone actually stay here until their mold problem is solved. My fiancé and I both were sick from the mold and it was even present in our double upgraded premium room. ",9/13/18,1

Second time staying here. Good price for hotel near Times Square. Definitely will stay here again. Only complaint i have is... they should clean behinf the bed. My so. Dropped a toy back there and once I looked I wanted to leave it behind.,9/13/18,4
"I was totally disappointed in the size of the room, especially for two persons to occupy. I requested an upgrade but I was told that the size of the room would not be much different. The only thing I like about this hotel is the location. ",9/13/18,2
"It’s my 6th time that I stay here in Row NYC. For this time, I traveled with my boyfriend too see Frozen on Broadway and we were just at 5 mins from the theater. Breakfast and Service were always excellent! ",9/12/18,5
"So I only stayed here for one night and wouldn't go more than that. As you approach and in the lobby, you definitely thing higher of the hotel.. but once you get to your room - it's a negative. It actually reminds me of a hostel, TBH. It is BASIC - only one soap bar in the bathroom (usually there is two, one at the sink and one in the tub), no small towels which some use to scrub/shower. My tub was clogged and the shower head didn't stay (almost like it times out after 10m). I would've called these things in if I was staying longer.The room looked suuuuuper rundown, like multiple crappy layers of paint and caulking on top of caulking, a really bad copy and paste job. It's smack dab in midtown/hells kitchen area but even for the location you can pay a bit more and stay at the Intercontinental which is right across the st. Honestly, it's a fancy hostel that's priced as a hotel. OH and the WiFi is weak AF, I ended up turning it off of my phone because it was laggy and slow. My room was also facing other hotel rooms which was weird because you could see inside the rooms which meant there are no window treatments - so I couldn't keep my blinds up (to get some light in) otherwise I'd lose my privacy.. so dum ",9/12/18,1

"I love Row NYV Hotel! I have stayed at this hotel every summer for the past 7 years. It is a beautiful bustling hotel right in the heart of Times Square. Within walking distance to Broadway shows, Rockefeller Center, Madison Square Garden and more! ",9/11/18,5
"I booked this hotel on Sept. 8 for one nights in Room 2351. My room was knocked Extremely Heavily and VERY rapidly at approximately 9:20 AM on Sept. 9th (I checked my phone after this incident happened) After which I yelled at the intruder to stay back, the intruder opened our room within about half a minute with his card!!!! Fortunately, I locked the door with the extra physical lock, the door was opened with a gap but as soon as the intruder noticed this, he quit immediately. This is an extremely dangerous incident and I do believe this is very dangerous for such thing to happen in a hotel experience. Further, before this thing happened, we were assigned in room 1232 where we noticed this huge rumbling sound that feels like a train passing by all the time! The bed sheet was covered with lots of dirt and the towels were just thrown on the floor of the bathroom. There is also a drink bottle left on the dest. We changed the room immediately as we felt extremely creepy and dark. The operator told us that the rumbling train like noise is due to the high-speed elevator. As we were changed to roommate 2351, we experienced this rob like incident. We were extremely unpleased with this horrible experience and we are here to alarm EVERY SINGLE PERSON, this hotel is HORRIBLE and LIFE THREATENING! Avoid with all COST ",9/10/18,1
"Our trip was better due to the hotel location in 8th ave and 44 st, near Times Square. It is a highly recommended place to stay during vacation. It is a comfort hotel, with a good service and great security ",9/10/18,4
"Good rooms, not so big. If needed there are ironing board & iron, hair dryer and safety box. Cleaning ok. Beds not so big,but ok if you are not too big people, clean and tidy. Possibility to drain drinking water on the corridors on flexible bottles, as well as the possibility to pick up ice cubes. The elevator system went this time several times in ""No lift"". Easy Express check-out. Luggage storage both on arrival and departure. Good luggage storage has been moved compared to last year ",9/10/18,4
"This was my second stay here. It has been renewed since the first time and for better. The breakfast area is nice and the staff there, too. Not so nice the staff at the check-in. I did not see a smile in their faces, and I was there waiting for some time ",9/8/18,4
"We had to pay for an upgrade in order to stay in the hotel. The room we booked was really small, looking into a wall and with extreme noise from a ventilator and the front desk told us that they had no other room available but we could pay for an upgrade, which we did because we were staying for 7 days. I think perhaps it would have been nice if the hotel would prioritize guest staying at the hotel for a longer period but they didn't. We stayed at ROW two years earlier and had a much nicer room, so we had expected better. Furthermore the rooms were dirty and the staff were stone-faced with no charm, we never received a kind smile. When leaving the hotel, leaving a big tip to the guys handling our suitcases, they didn't bother to hold the door. Poor service in general all over ",9/8/18,1
"I booked a 4 night stay a couple of months in advance. Specifically asked for a room on a lower floor, and followed up this request before I arrived. They ignored this and allocated me a room on 12th floor. When I got to the room the door was already open and someone had used the shower. Manager helpful but could re-room me until following day, and then room wasn’t ready until 4pm. On plus side they adjusted my final bill fairly. Hotel is well located for theatres etc. Very busy. Great food in attached dining facilit ",9/8/18,3
"Looks chic and sleek in pics, but the building is super old and pretty gross. I felt gross just breathing in there. The areas leading from elevator to room were especially bad. Decent location though ",9/8/18,2
"Room was tiny. Two suitcases and two carrying on, we had to play Tetris a bit. It was clean and location is great. Unfortunately, our room was located right next to a lift shaft, and we had two rocky nights having this lift cabin going up and down right next to us. One more thing; this damned facilities fee (two nights additional $68.-) is pissing me of. Of course, all the hotels in NY are charging this “extra” fee. I would like to pay for something I choose. I don’t need a gym arriving at 09.00 p.m. exhausted from the long trip. And here is the best!! Thins when we have to pay extra for a g....damned WiFi?!?!? And staff doesn’t feel you welcome.

The facilities fees are 30$ per day (so don’t trust on the price they give you at the beginning, with all the fees was more than 200$ more than expected) and... the facilities are way too far to be good. Pretty bad connection to the wifi, the mattress was so bad, too noisy, small room... I’ll never come back for that price. ",9/7/18,1
"Very well located and good price for money and decent room. Don’t expect nothing more, nothing less. Please retrain housekeeping service. No services. They charge 11dlls per package if you plan to deliver something. ",9/7/18,4
Chose this hotel for its location for a 2 night stay. First room we were given the bathroom was disgusting - I took a tissue covered in filthy slime down to reception to show them what I’d wiped off the shower- we were told to come back later and they would have another room. 2nd room wasn’t great but wasn’t filthy. Next problem occurred when we returned to the UK to find that they had charged us not only 2 nights in the first room but also the same 2 nights in 2nd room so we then had emails and phone calls to recover the amount overcharged. After received amount they took I asked for costs incurred due to their problem - cost of exchange from Sterling to Dollar by my bank which I was even charged on for them refunding. Also the cost of storing our luggage so that we could do some sightseeing while waiting on a clean room as the hotel doesn’t pay wages to the left luggage staff so they charge for the service. Several emails over several months and I have never been compensated for any of my costs caused by the hotel,9/7/18,2
"Didn’t know what to expect when reading reviews about this hotel as such mixed reactions.... however my true feeling on this hotel is that it’s spot on and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend....the only slight thing I would say is the room is very small but having said that we had two double beds and it was fine for our 3 night stopover!! It was clean, maid service everyday with a towel change, toiletries, safe, iron and good hairdryer and good WiFi!! Perfect location to explore everything New York has to offer, lots of nice restaurants nearby, and felt safe at all times within the proximity of the hotel!! Found reception staff friendly and efficient at all times!! Would definitely return on our next visit to NY! ",9/7/18,4
"Stayed here twice in 1 week. First room was so close to the ventilation there was a constant noise that any human couldn’t have slept through. Was moved to a better room. 2nd night, booked in a room that hadn’t been cleaned since the last guest. Moved again, to a room next to the extremely noisy elevator. Ended up paying extra to be moved somewhere quieter. This hotel really misses the point of a hotel being a place to sleep! To add to it, the rooms are dated and they aren’t cleaned properly to any standard, see my pics. Suffice it say, I won’t stay here again, neither should you ",9/6/18,2

"A first time experience in New York City and it did not disappoint. The high point of this hotel was the location. Being next door to the theatre district and a short walk to times square and the subway, we couldn't complain about having stayed dead centre of the big city. We went as a couple, and to be honest there are no real complaints about the hotel overall. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. ""The kitchen"" restaurant area was very modern and provided really nice food.The rooms were nice, for a city hotel. They were quite small and very simple. Our room was directly opposite the elevators, which we could hear throughout the night, as well as people coming in and out. This did not really bother us as we were so tired. But if this is something that would annoy you, be sure to ask for a room away from here. You do also hear the city life through the night too, which comes with the New York experience! I read a lot of complaints about the elevators and how slow they were. The system was pretty simple with you putting your floor number in a system, with it giving you a lift (A/B/C..etc) to get in, which is the quickest one to your floor. We found this worked well! Overall, for the price, the hotel is very nice, the rooms are very simple and nothing to brag about. If you wanted nicer hotel rooms you would need to look into a pricier hotel. But we hardly used the room and took advantage of the beautiful city ",9/6/18,4
"For the price of the hotel, the overall service was substandard. The good thing about this hotel is the location. However, the overall experience wasn’t great. When wr arrived September 2nd, we found hair in our washroom and called the front desk to have someone clean it. Nobody came. The next day, we told the cleaning person to come back in 15 minutes. When we came back hours later, our room wasn’t taken care of. After calling the front desk 3 times we were told that someone was going to come back and clean. Around 9:30 pm, we came back to a dirty room again and I had to go and speak to the manager at the front desk. We couldn’t use our washroom until 11 pm. This is not the service I was expecting for this hotel. ",9/5/18,2
Overall I dont think I will be back in this hotel. I thought we wpuld have a wonderful stay knowing this is our first time trying a hotel in New York and we came all the way to Los Angeles. We were expecting much better we our stay.,9/5/18,3
"Overall great stay.The customer service at check-in was wonderful. After a long travel day, it was refreshing to deal with a smiling face who went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful stay. I forgot his name, but I believe it was Juan (maybe) so thank you! Rooms are much smaller than what we are used to, but it is NYC, we didn't come there sit in our room. Beds were very comfy so made up for it. Negative: parking is a hassle and expensive. Location was key - close to Times Square, Central Park and a lot of the touristy things. It is a great location for those who have never been to NYC before and want to explore/do typical touristy things. ",9/5/18,5
"The room was really small. The cleanliness of the carpet and the bathroom was really cheap. The A/C was effective but very loud. The bed sheets were itchy because of the cheapness and the pillows were not comfortable so we didn't sleep well. Otherwise, the location was great (near Times Square) and the WiFi was good ",9/5/18,3

"My girlfriend and I came for the US Open but wanted to stay in Manhattan to see more of the attractions like Central Park and the Met when we weren’t watching tennis. Row NYC has one of the best locations of any hotel in New York City, and we were so pleased we booked there. Being so close to the Times Square - 42nd St subway station, everything we wanted to do was only a short walk or subway ride away. The only problem we had was having to prioritize our activities since we only had a few days there. We will definitely be back again.The commute was simple and easy to and from JFK. We just hopped on the AirTrain and only had to make one connection which really eased the stress of traveling. You’ll love the staff there. Everyone is so nice and helpful, always greeting you with a smiling face and making sure your stay is perfect.As for the accommodations, we were lucky enough to have reserved a 1-bedroom penthouse, and it was incredible. It was by far the nicest hotel room I’ve ever been in, and the sprawling views of the NYC cityscape and the Hudson River were the icing on the cake.If you’re coming to New York City, you should definitely take a look at Row NYC. You won’t be disappointed ",9/4/18,5
"I stay here once a year for a weekend. The location is fantastic, City Kitchen and the lobby is great. The rooms are dirty and run down. This hotel is extremely busy and they need to double their maintenance and cleaning staff...no way could their staff keep up with it. ",9/4/18,2
"I have stayed at the Row quite a few times in the last few years. I love it! It's convenient to Theaters, restaurants and just a few minutes walk to the major subway hubs at Times Square or The Port Authority. The Hotel itself is wonderful. The beds are comfy, the staff accommodating and very helpful. I have never had a difficult time with any issues being resolved. The adjoining City Kitchen is great for a quick bite with choices from Mexican to Ramen, Lobster Rolls to Sushi. The Row will continue to be my go to hotel for all my NYC trips! ",9/3/18,5
"Wasn't as happy as my previous stays here. It didn't seem as clean as before and they failed to help me with a problem I had at the front desk, basically just brushed me off. This is the only hotel I have used in Manhattan for years, but rethinking for future visits. ",9/3/18,3
"The location of this hotel is right in the heart of Times Square. Surprisingly once in our room , it was quite quiet and had a good nights sleep. The rooms are simple, but clean and no bells and whistles . The halls though are dark and very dated looking . The front staff was great and also staff around hotel . But what’s with the elevators . The wait to get on or off was over 10 minutes . Then there were times you did not make elevator due was full . So another 10 Minute wait . The strangest set up of elevators , I have ever seen. We heard some were broken also . Elevators assigned letters and once u picked ur number u waited at assigned elevator , although 5 other elevators , they could not be used . So unfortunately I won’t be staying here again. Plus, the resort fee not sure exactly what for as wifi was poor connection, printer in main lobby had problems also. So be weary if u go, don’t expect much and just go enjoy the amazing NYC. And do not buy coffee in hotel shop , 8 American dollars for 2 coffees .. ",9/3/18,2
"If you are looking ONLY for location, this is the hotel. It is located in the middle of Time Square, with a Shake Shake across the street and door to door to the City Kitchen. Staff was nice, rooms renovated was nice, but extremely small. The bathroom door rolls and do not lock. ",9/3/18,4
"Booked this hotel on a Friday, second day morning I received an email saying my payment info can not be processed, or this booking will be canceled automatically. So I called them up, a lady with thick accent answered and asked me to call the front-desk number. When I call the front-desk someone answered, and then the phone switched to a busy tone after 5 seconds. I called 3 more times, can never get through to someone to talk to about my online booking. So I thought I will let this booking automatically expire so I can book a different hotel instead. After the trip when i check my credit card payment history, the payment went through. I have to call my bank to deal with this. I am VERY disappointed about this scamming act. DON'T book this hotel through any means ",9/3/18,1
"I just returned from a stay at the ROW New York, and it was my sixth time staying there. It was absolutely fantastic! I can’t say enough about this amazing hotel. It is in the perfect location, one short block from the heart of Times Square, yet the prices are extremely reasonable. This was my first time brining my son, and they ensured he had an incredible experience there. All the staff are very helpful and courteous. Tom Hines is an absolute gem, always extremely helpful, professional and accommodating, I can’t say enough about him. He made sure we had a fantastic view, as seen in the attached pics. And the manager, Jessica, was also very helpful and pleasant to deal with. The rooms are always clean, the design is very modern, and the City Kitchen downstairs is very convenient and has great food options. If you want a comfortable stay in New York City right where the action is and not break the bank, I HIGHLY recommend ROW New York, it is absolutely perfect and I will not stay anywhere else ",9/3/18,5
Ceasar the manager is a gem of a person. Me and my wife stayed on the 31st of august 2018. He upgraded us to a good room given we had travelled alot to reach nyc. Ceasar is an asset of row hotel. I wish him best of luck in the industry and willl c hiim again soo,9/3/18,4
"What I saw on their website in terms of the bright lit rooms that are super clean is completely different from the physical rooms. The place is not impressive, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The hallway/passages to the rooms is not well lit and looks scary. The rooms are not well lit and the windows are very dirty. The wardrobe is very small and the entire room doesn't have enough space to keep suitcases because they don't fit in the wardrobe. The reception staff need to be more cautious and should provide better assistance to guests. ",9/3/18,1
We were there Aug 26th-28th 2018. We enjoyed the stay. Had no complaints. Everything went smooth perfect location. Nice hotel. Close to subway and times square.Had a room with a king bed once luggage is in room it's a bit small but doable,9/2/18,5
This hotel was perfect for our 3days/2nights stay ! The staff was very polite and kind. The room was great but could use a little refresh and the clim was really loud (we turned it off in the night and could hear the one in the other rooms).The location was perfect !! It took us 2 mins to go to Time Square.In overall we really like our stay at this Hotel and recommand it.,9/2/18,4
Hallway carpet needs vacuuming daily. Room should be cleaned and amenities are available before guest check in. Air conditioner inside the room is motion detected. It felt hot at night while we are sleeping and not moving at all,9/2/18,2
"I couldn’t deny that location wise, it is very convenient for tourists to stay in. However, the waiting time for taking the elevator is ridiculous. The higher floor you stay, the longer time you need to wait. It took me almost 20 minutes waiting for the elevator to the lobby! And it is so dusty in the room, I was wondering if the housekeeper uses the vacuum to clean up the room. I can see a lot of dust and some hair on the pillow and the bed sheet. Also there is some kind of funny smell in the restroom ",9/1/18,2
"Dirty room, hair all over bed, received indifferent management response. Did not sleep there, hotwire gave full refund and we moved to different hotel. This place should not have 4 star rating, its motel quality, at best. Location is good and lobby looks good but rooms was disgusting ",9/1/18,1
Location is wonderful. Close to everything in Times Square. Room is small but didn't spend a lot of time in the room. Breakfast downstairs is pricey. Concierge was very extremely helpful. Wonderful trip,9/1/18,5
"If you can book it for a fair price, it's a very good option. Checkin can take a long time. Rooms are small, but are clean and silent. Space is enough for 1-2 people. Bathroom is fine. Location is very good ",9/1/18,4
"This hotel is a great valu especially for the heart of the theater district. It has a fun ambience with an attached food court and cycle club in addition to their in-house bar and gym. They often run specials that include a good breakfast for a dollar The excellent staff eagerly and happily work hard to answer wuestions, solve problems, and help you out. They are very good on security. ",8/31/18,5
"I forgot my laundered shirt, that was still hung in the closet with the receipt attached to it. My name and contact information was on that receipt. It would have been simple for housekeeping to return my property. Instead, security said it was never found and housekeeping ignored all of my call and messages I am so disappointed by their lack of integrity I will never return to this hotel nor recommend it ",8/31/18,2
Excellent location great service! Definitely I will not just recommend but think of this as my first option when coming to the big city. Is the kind of service you are expecting of an hotel located on the most important city in the world,8/31/18,5
"Great Location for what I was there for, Broadway, just around the corner. Only negative we’re the long lines and check in and I tried to check in early but still had to wait in line. Not to mention it’s so crowded in the lobby because it’s connected to a restaurant. Also would have liked the rooms to be a little cleaner but overall good. ",8/31/18,4
"From the moment we decided to stay at the ROW hotel, throughout the reservation process, our room, the special and detailed amenities, until the last minute on the property, were the best in the world. We can only thank Karina Guardado for making our stay an exceptional experience. We’re very impressed with all the details the hotel have to make sure the guests are gonna enjoy their stay in NYC, they literally think ahead of all the needsThank you very muc ",8/31/18,5
"We had our second stay at the hotel within five weeks of our first. A really perfect location for Times Square and Broadway. Very good food court attached. Helpful staff and good security. The rooms are being updated, hence no 5 star. But that said a perfect choice for a New York hotel. Book direct for some amazing prices and free offers including free airport shuttle bus ",8/31/18,4
"I often stay at ROW NYC for business - 2-3 times a year. It's the location that wins every time, but after my last stay, I've decided it has changed, or I have. It's a laudable concept and well done. It's New York. Rooms are small. Bathrooms even smaller. But it's clean, has some quirky decor, Indian market murals, dark corridors and a hang out area rather than a trad restaurant area. It's so close to Times Square (not my fave) and Hell's Kitchen (love the restaurants), it's hard to resist. Rates are ok. But it's become more and more like a youth hostel, hundreds of kids handing about the lobby last two times. Nowhere to take 5, do some emails and have a quiet coffee before the next meeting. Staff have never been the friendly type here- actually that's not quite true. Reception staff are all New Yorks cliches in uniform- surly, brusque. Porters and others seem more accomodating and friendly. I stay no more than 3 days. I couldn't take any more. Feels like being on a space station - all basic needs met, but lacking human touch. I'ts probably me that's changed. On reflection, I would recommend it for younger people, people on short city breaks who want to be very central and people who are not travelling on business. That's not me anymore. I'm done ",8/31/18,3
Very good location although 8th avenue is quite dirty and busy. It is worth to be a couple of blocks from downtown NY and times square. Rooms are just small size but enough for a couple. Rooms are clean and service is good. It is a good alternative for a 3 day trip to NY. Location is very good,8/31/18,4
We stayed here earlier in the year. Great location. Great staff. We received a very warm and friendly welcome from Junior at the check in desk. He was brilliant and so helpful. We had to extend our stay due to flight cancellations and Junior was so helpful..he couldn't do enough to help us get sorted. Room were clean and bed very comfortable. Nice bar in reception to,8/31/18,4
Nice location. Good accommodations. It was near Times Square and made it very easy to access all attractions in the area. The room was on a high floor which made the view pretty nice. Very good hotel and staff,8/31/18,5
"the hotel is in a very good location very good beds no refrigerator and a kettle for hot drinks, restrooms are small and not so comfortable .but overall is very good. i prefer breakfast as part of the deal. so you can spend the hours of the day better ",8/31/18,4
It was small but cozy and the blackout shades were perfect for our night of rest. All though the bathroom was super small the space overall was just what we needed. View wasn’t bad and the bed was extra cozy,8/31/18,5
found toe nail clippings on the carpet. rooms should be inspected by housekeeping super to ensure cleanliness.no fan or air circulation in the bathroom plus the bathroom is entirely too small.the price of the rooms is very reasonable but the taxes are outrageou 85.85 for one night and in all the taxes plus 30.00 for facility fees cost 136.00 second night 118.00 plus tax and fee 176.00. never again,8/30/18,2
Hot bakery to be included rather than just the cold ones. At least Water bottles and tea to be included in the rooms. More focus to be put onto renovation of room. They changed our refrigerator after one night as it froze everything in it so they did not charge us for that.,8/30/18,3
"I have been a frequent guest of Row, from when they started renovations years ago, and continue to make this my hotel of choice every time I am in NY. Now not only do I stay here but pretty much every work colleague that comes to the city (which is frequent) as well. The rooms and closets are small but this is NY and you will find this in almost any hotel BUT the rooms are clean, the beds comfortable and the staff is extremely pleasant and helpful. If you want a great experience upgrade to a city view room as there is nothing better than watching the city lights at night.The hotel is a perfect location for the times square experience and their onsite food has a lot of great options - Sugar Shack, District M and City Kitchen. Highly recommend for any length of visit ",8/30/18,5
"Excellent stay. Very cool and close to Times Square, Port Authority (metro station), restaurants and Broadway shows. Easy to access. Nice amenities. Lobby bar with live shows. Employees are always nice. ",8/30/18,5
"I’ll try to make a full review of all the main points: CHECK IN (begins at 4pm)Check in takes 5/10 minutes which is understandable because there are a lot of guests. After all, it’s New York City we are talking about. However, staff does their job and nothing more. So, in another words, staff is not friendly. They are not unpleasent, let that be clear, but they do seem tired of listening to people all day long. When you check in, you are happy and excited to be in a new hotel and in a new place and your first image of the place/hotel is for sure how the staff of the hotel welcomes you. I think Row Hotel could do better. “MANDATORY FACILITY FEE”: When you book this hotel, you may have the idea that the wifi is free (included). Be aware that wifi is not free at all. There is a MANDATORY fee of 34,42$/per room/per night which includes ROW Pass, all phone calls; wifi for unlimited devices; an eco-friendly, collapsible water bottle; access to the third floor fitness center; internet access and printing services in iMac lounge. PHONE: So you pay your facility fee and you get “free calls”: home or international. The telephone works this way:If you want to make an international call you dial: (9011) (countrycode) (number)If it doesnt ring for lets say 3/4 seconds, wait a little bit. Sometimes it gives a signal only after 10/15 seconds. But if there is no signal at all after 20/30 seconds, go to the concierge and ask them to check your phone because it may have some problem. ROOM: The rooms are indeed small. Some of them are very small. Once again, it’s New York City so there’s no point in expecting big rooms. The beds are comfy, the forniture is modern and modest. There is a desk, a flat tv screen, a telephone, Iron and ironing board, Hair dryer, Safe with keypad entry, Full-length mirror which is handy. The best floors for a great view are 23,24,25,26... Impossible to be inside the room with the air conditioner turned on. So much noise. It’s very bad. Very very loud. Like seriously loud. BATHROOM: Very small, but you dont need much more. Nice mirror, “pure” shampoo, soap, etc which is super nice.Our bathroom had a window that didnt close but the weather is currently nice in NYC so it didnt bother us. The shower is good, but needs urgent repair. Seems fragile and you are afraid it will fall off at any moment. Besides that, the bathroom is pretty nice and clean. I would say we didnt like the fact that there is no real door to the bathroom. Just a sliding door that does not do a good job. Obviously there’s a big gap between the wall and the door so i think bathrooms should have proper doors. HOTEL LOBBY:Full of people all of the time. 6am? 7am? 8am? You name it. Always crowded. No worries though, it gives the hotel some funny ambience aswell. You get the nyc spirit of rush and crowds for sure. The lobby is quite big so you can enjoy being on iMacs or sitting around studying your maps. CHECK OUT (at 11pm but you can only check out at 12pm with no extra charges) You can leave your bags at the hotel and go for a walk. There’s no official fee but it’s recommended you give 1$ per bag. It’s really up to you. CLEANING SERVICENothing special really. But nothing to complaint about. The minimum service required I would say. HOTEL AREA:When you leave the hotel, be prepared for the crowds... I think the hotel’s location is one of its greatest and worst things. It’s great because you are near times square. It’s bad because.... you are near times square. No silence at all at any time. However, you can book a broadway show, take a bath, have dinner at the hotel or nearby and walk a few minutes to watch your show! Awesome really. It’s a nice hotel and we were happy staying in Row, but I think I’ll try another hotel next time in NYC! ",8/30/18,3
There should be fridge in the room or at least Ice machines in all floors. Rooms are very small and closets are tiny with few hangers. Queen beds aren't the size expected. Room service is great. The music player in elevators is really appreciated,8/30/18,3
Loved the cleanliness of the hotel and the room the view of the city from the 14th floor was excellent. The security was very good. Our overall experience was wonderful and we will be coming back to stay. The location was perfect for travels within the city,8/30/18,5
"What can I say? The hotel was central to the theatre district, in close proximity to the Port Authority, and subway. So many restaurants to choose from. The fact they closed 8th avenue and made it into a wonderful street festival ",8/30/18,5
Great for a quick one night stay in NYC. The room was small but funky and for all the time spent in the room it was good. Staff were very friendly and helpful and the Citizen M bar was great! Great location,8/30/18,5
Stayed here for 4 nights. All I can say is it has an excellent location. After that not a lot going for it. Our room was tiny - barely space to walk around bed but was clean and had a comfortable bed. Corridors dark nd dreary. No breakfast- just a coffee dock. Suitable for quick visit but depressing if u were here longer. Loved NYC so didn’t spend too long in hotel,8/29/18,2
"Staff was nice, even thought staff forgot to clean my brother's room one morning. My registration agent Yanell, (poss spelled incorrect) was kind and did every thing in her power to accommodate my family ",8/29/18,3
"The hotel is certainly an economic choice and an ideal location but this comes at a cost in comfort. Personally I actually felt dirty just touching anything in the building and it's just a matter of cleaning with rags and soap. Light switches, which everyone has to touch, had dirt all around them and worn off in the middle where people were touching it. I understand the small rooms and the older style but cleanliness is not acceptable. Staff are polite enough and the hotel was perfect for what we were doing I just think they need staff to go clean the rooms from top to bottom and then keep up with it. ",8/29/18,3
"Stayed at this hotel last week and was highly impressed. Staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms was cleaned every single day, with clean towels every day. Considering the hotel is on a main road ( 5 minutes roughly from Times Square) the rooms are very quiet. The beds are super comfy, the blinds are blackout blinds which is perfect. A tv facing the beds which is also perfect. When you come in on the evening security are standing in front of the lifts and will not let no one in unless you all show your lift pass, I think this is excellent. Will I stay here again? Of course I will and I have also recommended this hotel to everyone I know. ",8/29/18,5
"Just back from my two night stay at Row NYC. Just like the last time, my stay was perfect. The reception area is always busy but moves fast and the staff are very helpful (man in pink shirt - give him a promotion). The rooms are small but this is NYC so what do people reallly expect, especially with the proximity to Times Square. We got the superior room upgrade which is worth the money, even has a bath and loads of room. Rooms also had a safe which is handy. Check in and out was easy. Check in isn’t untill 4pm but if you can’t find something to do for a couple of hours in New York then you’ve got a real problem. Also check out isn’t untill 12pm, so you get an extra hour in comparison to most of the other hotels. Obviously you pay a resort fee of around $30 per night but in comparison to Vegas (where it can be 40-60$) I think it is reasonable. Staff cannot help you enough from the reception desk to the men who store your luggage for you. See you soon ",8/28/18,5
"Hotel was awesome the first time we stayed here. Our latest stay wasn't so great. Internet was wonky, we had an additional charge added to bill, didn't have any face towels in the room and no one answered the phone when we called ",8/28/18,3
"Very convenient location to Times Square, Broadway etc. Room comfortable, helpful staff. Would stay here again and would recommended. System for using the very fast lifts excellent - no waiting. Enjoyed visit ",8/28/18,4
"very close to theatres, rooms are on the smallish side but have most things you need. would be great to be able to make a coffee or tea in your room but an easy lift ride down to purchase one. easy check in and check out and a smooth stay with no problems ",8/28/18,4
"Great location to see any Broadway show! Our 1st trip to NYC and it was perfect. Hotel on 8th between 45th & 46th, Sardi's is on 45th, Schmackery's is on 49th. Close to subway! Highly recommend. Bathroom was a bit small, but functional. Get the room with a view ",8/28/18,4
"From check in to check out this really made our brief trip the best!! Junior was awesome, he was able to upgrade our room at no additional cost and even gave us complimentary drinks at the bar to kick off my 50th - If ever back we'll stay here...no doubt, perfect location to times square and all broadway show ",8/28/18,5
"This hotel was lovely and clean, the room was quite small but had everything you need for the short time that we were actually in the hotel room (shower and sleep). I used the gym during my stay and although it was small it again had everything you needed for a good workout. The art decor in the hotel was lovely with some eye-catching murals on the room landings. The reception was lovely although I couldn't help but notice the pungent smell that was sometimes in the lobby area. All the staff that I spoke to were lovely, the guys outside were always happy to help with any questions about the area ",8/27/18,4
"We arrived to the hotel early and left our luggage in the luggage store. When we returned later we were advised they would get the luggage brought up straight away. We had to Waite 2 hours, after a call down the bellman brought them up. Room not particularly clean. Broken toilet door lock, broken air con grate top. 2 of everything when there’s 3 of us. Shower head rusty. Black mould around bath. Loose wires. Double bed not a double bed very small for 2 people. Glad we are only here for a few days ",8/27/18,2
"My wife and myself stopped at the Row NYC for 4 nights over Christmas. We had a wonderful experience. District M in the lobby is in a food court style with lots of choices, although it can get a little busy at times. The location of the hotel is great, literally walk out the front door and take the first street on your right and follow it along for a couple of minutes and you are in Times Square. Beware of service charges that have to be paid on check in, I think it was around $25 per day to cover wi-fi and telephone etc, so remember to budget extra for this.The hotel is very very clean and no noise either. Does not have facilities to make hot drinks in the room either but a ride down the lift and across the lobby and district M had coffee and doughnuts  ",8/27/18,4
"Disappointing experience - room small and very smelly. Could do with steam cleaning carpets and general overhaul. Felt like a hostel, not a four star hotel...Good location for Times Square and cafe downstairs was pleasant. Handy location for all site seeing buses but not worth the price unfortunately... ",8/27/18,1
"It's a very convenient hotel, less than 5 min. walking from Times Square, and on walking distance of many visitable NYC spots. The quality of the service, customer attention and care are awesome. Quite appealing hotel. ",8/27/18,4
Bad sleep because house keeping woke us up both mornings. Other than the hotel is quite cleans and a good location In the middle of Times Square . Recommend to people who will stay in that area but my friend and I did not have the best time.,8/26/18,1
"The staff was excellent and helpful. The location for Broadway plays, Times Square, fabulous restaurants, and the subway can't be beat. I traveled alone with my granddaughter, and we felt very safe and secure in his hotel. I drove and the hotel took excellent care of my car. ",8/26/18,5
"Great location, clean room, fairly comfortable, but the rooms are all rather small. The bathroom in my room was too tight and close, with no moving room or space to put personal products on the sink. And the shower didn't have a full spray ",8/26/18,3
"The hotel is walking distance to all plays you want to go, plus Time Square, Hell's kitchen restaurants and Shake Shack. Staff is friendly, specially Junior.The rooms are not that big but they are renovated, clean and cozy. Bathroom is ok. ",8/26/18,5
"The decor was dark and the lobby/hallways were smelly. The rooms are bright with color. The air conditioning is extremely loud. The beds needed new bed pillows. That being said, we arrived very late, 1:35 am. The gentleman at the door offered to valet park our car , needless to say we were so happy. The location is a good . Try it out, you might like it. ",8/26/18,4
"Like the title says it’s a little pricey and they get you with deposits and other fees but what hotel in NYC isn’t expensive? It’s in a good location, the rooms are nice (could be a little nicer for the price), the staff are friendly. All in all I enjoyed my time here until I received my bill but hey treat yourself! ",8/26/18,4
"If you want a hotel to stay and rest while you are all day out exploring New York for a competitive price, than this hotel is definitely worth to consider. With Time Square only a block away this hotel puts you right in the heart of the matter. Perfect for first time visitors to NY like us. ",8/26/18,4
"Checkin was a breeze after a hectic and lengthy delay at the airport. Arrived later than expected and checkin was a breeze. Pleasant staff, room was smaller than expected. Felt like i was onboard a cruise ship somewhat lol. Would stay agai ",8/25/18,4
"This place ended up with the cheapest prices which was unexpected so I decided to try it. The location is amazing, right across the street from the subway, right by Broadway. It was great staying at a place you could actually go back to multiple times a day if you needed to. The room was fine - smallish but quiet enough. The little food court was also very convenient and the food worked out. Good for a quick bite. I was surprised it was cheaper then places farther out but I'll stay again if the price is close enough ",8/25/18,3
"I really liked ROW NYC. It was easy to check in and check out. I liked that I was able to check in and out from my phone, that made it so much easier to get in and out. I would definitely return to ROW NYC ",8/25/18,4
Smallest room with the smallest bed I have ever seen. Started as a two night stay with two double beds. Needed to changed to one night which was done well in advance. Then we ended up with the smallest room and smallest bed I have ever seen. Good thing my daughter and I like each other. Check in line was way too long. Location was perfect so we endured,8/24/18,3
"I was happy to receive an email allowing me to check in online and pick up my key at the lobby kiosk. Sadly, The kiosk did not recognize my name and I stood in line for over 30 minutes while only two people worked at the registration desk. The lobby was noisy and crowded, and there was trash on the floor as there was in the hallways. The hotel is decorated with large photographic murals covering entire walls and neon displays that distract from the poor condition of the doors, the trim, and the lack of general upkeep.My room was tiny, which is not necessarily a problem.It looked out on some other hotel rooms so I needed to keep the curtains closed. The bedding was clean and there were plenty of towels.But the furniture and built in fixtures in the room were chipped and worn. The bathroom was clean but needed renovation. All guests are charged a $30 facilities fee. This is supposed to cover access to the gym, Internet, a special plastic water bottle, and discounts in local stores that can be accessed using the room key. There was no water bottle. I forgot to ask for the Internet password and when I called downstairs to get it the phone just rang and rang so I gave up. And I didn’t have time to use the gym. Facilities fee seems to go for things that are included in any other hotel stay as part of the base price. It’s a bit deceptive. Also, there is no in room coffee maker or tea or bottled water or any of the things travelers like me have grown used to Which is partially why the facilities she is so infuriating ",8/24/18,2
Midtown Manhattan is incredibly busy and costly . For location and overall value this hotel is the obvious choice . No one likes the sting of the additional facilities fee ( 30 dollars ) but it’s the norm . Breakfast is ok - limited portion but excellent quality . The gym is good . Allow 10 mins for using the lift - all hotels are busy . The manager is excellent and understands customer service . He moved us to a better and quieter room on hearing of a difficult first night of being near the lift . The city never sleeps,8/24/18,4
"Maybe your review depends on the room you're assigned, but I found check-in a breeze, never waited more than a minute or so for the elevator (to 22nd floor), the front desk was helpful in letting me check in early so I could prepare for a work assignment after travel, and my end-of-hallway room (2227) was very clean and quiet ",8/24/18,4
"Had a great experience from check in to check out. Beautiful and spacious room, comfortable king bed, great view of the Hudson river, and a fun bar in the lobby. Our bartender even arranged a round of drinks for my birthday. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat ",8/24/18,5
"its easy to get evrywhere bus terminal, subway station and broadway theatre.....The room was very clean and the staffs were so kind.we could sleep well even the hotel is inthe center of NYC.I will come back and stay there next time again because price was reasonable too ",8/23/18,4
Staff is pleasant and very helpful (that is EVERYONE we encountered over the phone and in person!) We go to NYC for the shows and this is within walking distance of everywhere we would want to go. The atmosphere is so convivial that it spreads to the guests. Each person I encountered seemed genuinely happy.,8/23/18,4
"Rude staff. Poor service. Poor value for money, for a little more you can go stars around the corner.. it not worth climbing down 24 flights of fire stairs due to the broken lifts, the black fungus falling from the air-con onto your mouth or the leaking bathroom in the impossibly small rooms with really no amenities.. Foyer is like grand central station. The pictures and the some of the other ""reviews"" are at best misleading. ",8/23/18,1
"Happy I made Row NYC my choice. convenient location, good food. clean room. I will return. They are nice to upgrade to better upon request. Easy check in and out. If you are visiting NYC, make Row your choice ",8/23/18,5
I recommend this hotel to many guest in Manhattan the quality is great and the service is fantastic the area is exquisite it's in a main area where a lot of tourist come to visit so it's worth it PS great deal,8/23/18,4
"Nice room, although we had to pay a bit extra to have city views, clean and confortable room, refurbished a few years ago! Located in the heart of Brodway and near to all the theaters and Times Square! Subway across the street from were you can get anywere! Fast Check in, and OUT, you just leave your keys in a mail box at the reception. Wonderful, wonderful city!!! A bit noisy sometimes with all the ambulances and firetrucks but... wonderful indeed! ",8/23/18,4
"8th Avenue isn’t the most pretty of locations for a stay in the city, but it must rank as one of the most convenient. Close to Times Square, Broadway shows, tour buses, including The Ride, Penn Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal.So, what’s the hotel like? Nothing fancy but offers clean, quiet, air conditioned rooms with a choice of casual dining attached to the hotel. The cafe/bar near the lobby is small and often crowded for a 28 floor hotel. The elevator system results in a wait occasionally due to the number of people queuing. Frequented by cabin crew from a few airlines, the hotel offers a good standard of comfort for a reasonable price. Although don’t forget to add on the $50 resort tax per room - payable upon check-in ",8/23/18,3
"The hotel is great. It s near Times Square, about 5 min walking. The rooms are clear and the food is good. Pay attention to the check out because I found some things added. Anyway, when I said it to the staff, they fixed it. So, just pay attention. I had some problem with the room when I split it with my friend during the check out. ",8/23/18,4
"Well situated for Times Square and Broadway. Public areas and food hall area very busy, but that's New York. The room was quite small (for America) but clean with a comfy bed. It served a purpose for our 3 night stay. It had a great lift system ",8/23/18,4
"Had a great time, loved the view and the room and bed were very comfortable. The location was central enough to get to the film fest we attended at the Lincoln Centre, and to a variety of attractions. ",8/22/18,5
The Row NYC is a great hotel for theatre goers! Location is perfect to walk to theatres and Times Square. Our room with a view on the 27th floor was very clean and modern. We loved it! The only complaint we had is that the wifi connection was not good.,8/22/18,4
"I booked this hotel through hotel tonight for a one night stay. The hotel lobby and hallways have a musty smell, hallways were dirty and dark. Bathtub did not drain well so you take a shower in a puddle of water. Toilet had pee stains and the tiles and the back of the bathroom door had random long hairs and stains of who knows what. The most uncomfortable pillows I have ever laid my head on. Management really needs to look into replacing these. My sister and I tossed and turned the entire night due to how uncomfortable the pillows were. Woke up with a bad headache due to this. I’m not sure what kind of housekeeping they are doing cause the the side tables and lamps had a thick coat of dust and hairs on the desk. All in all this was one of the worst hotels stays. The only pro to this hotel is the location other than that it’s a dump ",8/22/18,1
"dont expect coffee in the room or a fridge or a microwave. dont expect to find water and ice easily, or for anyone to know where a working machine is. dont expect to be able to go floor to floor looking for said water and ice....or even to be able to get back to your floor easily. rooms are very small. expect alot of charges for resort fees and taxes. ",8/22/18,3
"Location, location, location. Walk to Broadway, walk to Times Square, walk to Central Park, walk to 42nd Street Pier, walk to Penn Station, walk to Madison Square Gardens. And walk to more great restaurants than I can count ",8/22/18,5
"Enjoyed the stay and being so close to the NYC action. Even though its a busy place - the hotel is an excellent choice for being in the middle of all activities, yet having a quiet place to stay for the night. ",8/21/18,4
"The front desk staff took the time to make friendly conversation and offer suggestions on places to go out for dinner and places to visit around town at night. She also gave me info for to look into discounts for business travel, definitely be back! Great job ",8/21/18,5
"Second visit at this hotel. Stayed for 4 nights, got upgraded to a corner room with a view as we were on honeymoon. Clean, friendly and great location. Yes check in can take a while, the rooms are a bit smaller than some others but plenty big enough and the bathroom is a good size. The staff are very helpful and it’s in a great location, 4-5 mins stroll from Times Square. Would highly recommend ",8/21/18,4
"Ever have to wait 30 minutes on line to check into a hotel? Well, you'll get to experience this if you book this hotel. Nice enough rooms, clean and comfortable. Good location if you don't mind the crowds of Times Square. Great nearby restaurants. VERY close to Broadway for shows. ",8/21/18,3
"Basic hotel but good location, nice room and comfy beds. This is my 2nd time to stay here. Everything was great !! My friend asked for something special on my birthday the the reception gave us free drink and nice view so thank you.. I will give your a first choice if visit NY ",8/21/18,4
"My Daughter and I had a great time . I wish there was a folder in the room with information in it about room service, things happening in town, maybe restaurants information since it was restaurant week and maybe a map of the area of fun things to do and se ",8/21/18,5
"This is a average hotel, clean, small rooms definitely not 4* in standards in Ireland or UK. Location however it has it all within walking distance. If using transport that takes you to the port authority or pen station you can walk to here. If you arrive early the hotel allows you to complete check in but will not allocate your room till 4pm but they will hold your luggage so you can start exploring immediately. All within walking distance Central park, Broadway, times square, Macy's Empire state building and many more ",8/21/18,4
"Our experience there was for four days, and every day was Fabulous. All who we interacted with were over the top friendly, effective and efficient in their role. the location of hotel is excellent. The room was well cleaned every day. I left my iPad in room safe by mistake and discovered once I got home I assumed it would be difficult and take weeks to get it back if I got back at all. Contrary to my thoughts the staff at “list and found” and the system in place for mailing and returning it was excellent. I had it in my hands three days later. I am very impressed with how that situation was resolved favorably. ",8/21/18,5
"Fantastic location. Basic hotel but does have a nice bar though not cheap. Very comfy beds, most of the staff were helpful and friendly. The rooms don't have tea and coffee facilities that I think they need. ",8/21/18,4
"I have been staying at the hotel for over 40 years. I consider it my home away from home.The location is prime and the outstanding friendly professional staff make an enjoyable stay.I highly recommend the hotel for business or pleasure. The available services from the Kitchen to the bar are added value. At the heart of the Theater district, it is an easy walk to a Broadway show ",8/20/18,5
"Yes it's in Midtown... But I was charged an extra $100 fee to my credit card that is refunded when checking out upon arrival which they do not tell you when booking. They also charge you all of these extra fees, $30 for Wifi and a compostable water bottle that's probably worth $2. I was told while booking that you can pick 3 rewards when you check in. I was told one of them was free parking. Parking cost $40 a day. When I asked about the rewards the man at the desk said free parking wasn't one of them. He didn't really know how to redeem the rewards. While checking out, same thing, the guy at the desk said ""he thinks"" I go to some website to redeem the rewards. The water dispenser on my floor was broken. There is no fridge in the hotel room or coffee machine, which even a crappy motel would have. I went to go to the hotel bar, and the security told me they weren't allowing anyone in, I assume it was a private event. I think this place is a rip off. I will never stay here again ",8/20/18,2
This hotel is a block and a half from ground zero Times Square. Location was perfect for going to plays but also has some great restaurants within 5 blocks. I can't say enough about the staff at the cafe off the lobby  we ate all our breakfasts there and the staff was so friendly and helpful all 5 days - and we're from the southwestern US so we know what nice looks like! Regular rooms are small but adequate but we didn't spend much time there anyway so not an issue,8/20/18,3
I always stay at the Row Hotel Proximity to theaters and to public transportation is amazing Love how international the hotel is The price is right for Times Square area The staff and rooms are great I don't need a lot but what they give is the bes,8/20/18,5
"The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location. That is superb, close to Times Square, just steps away from the subway. Easy to get around by foot or public transportation. Other than that I was greatly disappointed. I was looking at several hotels in the area, but chose Row for the price. I booked a deluxe room with city view. There was a city view, but other than that there was nothing deluxe over the room. Small and unclean. The carpet was dusty, items from other guests left behind and it felt quite nasty. The bathroom was small, but surprisingly clean compared to the room. I had connecting doors of both sides if the room, and I could literary hear evey conversation from both rooms. Terrible! And the glitch under the entrance door was so huge I had trouble sleeping when other guests came and went in the night. The lobby is noisy and cool enough, but the elevator system is not the best. I also experienced a terrible smell in the elevators during late evenings/morning.The check in was for me arriving late at night very fast, but when I went down later during the stay to ask for the possiblity to pay for a late check out on my departure day and got a uninterested look and really no answer... I will never stay here again, but look for other deals in the area! ",8/20/18,2
"Great Theater location! Easy access from the bus station, if you bus it in. Great selection of food, in the food court area. Rooms are smaller, 4 people in a room is tough with luggage. If you are higher up, the wait time for an elevator might be longer. No coffee makers in the room, so in the morning prepare for a long run for coffee ",8/20/18,4
"We had tickets to go see Hamilton and the hotel’s location was the first draw. It was convenient and everyone was friendly and courteous. Didn’t eat at City Kitchen or go into the bar area, but seemed like a nice addition to the hotel. Would definitely recommend ",8/20/18,5
"The hotel was good, and very convenient. However, we booked our pre-paid reservation via Agoda, but the hotel would not provide the double-double room we booked. We had to pay an additional $40/night to get what we had originally booked for ",8/19/18,4
"The hotel it’s self is great but the service was a bit lacking. For example, we valeted our car and they sent our car to the wrong hotel and we ended up waiting over 45 minutes to get it. The we not apologetic about it at all and while we were waiting they keep telling us it was 5 minutes away. Finally, my friend used her iphone to check where it was and it was less that a block way not moving. They finally admitted that the valet took it to the wrong hotel. It was a mess! The rooms themselves were really nice and a good price so there’s that ",8/19/18,3
"We've stayed for 3 nights in the Row NYC. Excellent location, but there it stops. We didn't get the reserved (and payed extra for!) city view deluxe room, but a room with a view on a brick wall.Big disappointment, but nothing thad could be done... No refund, no complementary drinks, nothing. Really disappointing ",8/19/18,3
"Good location but dirty rooms, we had 2 rooms but both were dirty , hair chewing gum etc etc.Won't come back again. Loud and more like a hotel for teenager or hostel where u can party. Reception did not seem to care about my complaint about the messy rooms either.. ",8/19/18,1
"Thank you to all of the staff,in particular Gregg Wheeler, for making us feel welcome and important as visitors to Row and NYC. The convenience of the hotel to subway and taxis made sightseeing and visiting easy. ",8/19/18,5
"Location wise it is great - close to food, times square, subway stations etc. However, the hotel not that great. When we checked into our room, the bath was disgusting with hair in it although the rest of the room was clean-ish. We unfortunately got a room by the lifts which was extremely annoying because we constantly hear them and got no sleep for the nights we were there. Saying that, the location was very convenient and the staff at the door (not desk) were extremely helpful and friendly ",8/19/18,3
"The hotel has a very strange smell, like urine, in the elevators and hallway. While I enjoyed the quick pre check in experience the only interaction we had with a staff member seemed so rushed and no introduction of hotel facilities was shared. Our door felt so flimsy and kept making loud sounds every time someone was in the hallways and we really had awful sleep as a result. ",8/18/18,3
"Awesome location close to attractions and transport. Clean and comfy bed. Great air con. Good internet. I think the staff could be more helpful. Check in is a bit of a shambles, especially when is busy. We checked in early and had to come back once out room was ready, told we wouldn’t have to queue again, but due to ‘short staffing’. We had to queue again. No big deal, just a bit annoying. Often long queues for check in and also the lifts. Wanted to go to the bar twice, once it was closed (1130 on a Friday night- bit weird), and today after check out, had to wait ten minutes for someone to turn up to serve me. Also the hotel could benefit from some tourist maps and information. Also it’s a bit unclear how everything works, eg I was trying to get the computers in the lobby to print. Wouldn’t work, and no one to ask. So I just gave up. Also no water available on out floor (16). Would stay here again, mainly for the location. Cheers! ",8/18/18,3
"For most of us, any trip to New York City is welcomed on our travel itinerary. Whether for work, for vacation, or to visit family and friends, what better destination is there? Not surprisingly, nightly hotel rates in Manhattan and Brooklyn are usually at the $250+ price point. Of course, there will be some deals during the year, but when your dates are set, you need to find the best possible option at a fair price.In preparation for our recent visit, we perused the many hotel options, but with a specific eye toward something of high quality, in a central location, with thoughtful design, and at a competitive price point. And so our search led us to Row NYC, located one block west of Times Square at 700 8th Ave, New York, NY 10036. Granted, this might at first seem like a frenetic location, and it is in fact high volume and high activity at all hours. Yet despite this, when you enter Row NYC you are greeted by amazing staff curbside and are ushered into a stylish ground floor entry where you can take a grand, minimalist staircase to the main lobby level, use the dedicated elevator if you have luggage in tow, or decide to pop into Sugar Factory, the café and decadent confectionary, for a caffeine or sugar boost before exploring everything else that Row has to offer.The main lobby is a gorgeous combination of well-chosen interior materials and fun accessories that all flow from one space to the next. To the right is District M, “Café By Day, Lounge By Night,” up the stairs is City Kitchen “Your Gourmet Food Market,” and to your left is a bank of large iMacs that offer 24/7 access for basic internet needs. The concierge and front desk area is well designed to handle the high volume of nightly guests. To check-in, you can use the self-service monitors and have a brief wait in the queue to see one of the professional staff members. With so much under one roof, Row does an excellent job of acquainting you with your options. When it’s time to head up to your room, dedicated elevators whisk you skyward in small groups, to limit delays and overcrowding. Hallways have flattering mood lighting to guide you to your room and (thankfully) all keyless entry cards worked flawlessly. (No more unnecessary trips back down to the front desk). Guest rooms are well-appointed, which makes up for the standard square footage scale you find in most New York hotels. The sleek design keeps the space open while basic functionality is nicely concealed, but easily accessible.As a guest you are offered 10% discount on all products and services throughout the property. Glam & Go is an express beauty bar to get you ready for a night at the Broadway shows or a light night adventure down to in the Meatpacking District or Lower East Side. To burn off the night before, or for those dedicated to staying at their fighting weight, the 24/7 Fitness Studio on the 3rd floor is there for you. Want to take it to another level? CYC Fitness is a “beat-based indoor cycling experience, designed to work your body and mind.” What more can you say? If you decide to stay in and make a night of it, District M offers a thoughtful cocktail and wine list, a tasty tapas menu, and a digital art installation commissioned by Ron Galella. After a few rounds and some light bites, it’s time to step upstairs to City Kitchen. There you’ll find a mouth-watering area of culinary options set in an edgy, urban environment. Cuisines ranges from tacos, to sushi, to barbeque, along with some other unexpected delicacies in between. This was our first stay at Row NYC and we were more than pleasantly surprised. The combination of sexy interiors, diverse food and drink options, plus premium service amenities made this a memorable stay.If you haven’t been to NYC in awhile, why not grab a flight and a worthy companion and make a weekend of it ",8/18/18,5
"Everything was awful. Staff horrible, rooms disgusting, lifts took over 10 minutes.. yuck yuck yuck. Stay away - this place is a rip off and just so bad. Room was small and dirty. You have to wait around 10 minutes for the lift to come to your floor. Staff were rude and wait times at front desk were up to 30 minutes. Facilities were a complete joke too. This place needs to be ripped apart and they need to start agai ",8/18/18,1
"Top four star rated hotel located in Times Square, very good value great staff, very good fast food restaurants.. I have no more to say--this program with not take the complete review unless it contains 200 letters!! redicious software ",8/18/18,5
Beautiful room with a great view of the city. We took the $14.oo upgrade and it was worth it. Enjoyed breakfast at City Kitchen. Would have liked bottled water in room instead of having to use tap water for taking medication. We will return the next time we visit NYC,8/18/18,5
"Great location, reasonable prices for NYC, courteous staff! Our second stay here, recommended originally by friend. Nice food court connected to hotel which is great for a quick breakfast or lunch. Would recommend for short visits ",8/18/18,4
"Where do I start? This was - in all my years of traveling over 2,000,000 miles -the worst hotel experience ever. My wife and daughter — after the first night —decided to check out given the poorly kept and unclean conditions of the room. I waited forever in line to express my displeasure after trying to contact the switchboard to try to rectify the problem. After a while of waiting and speaking to barely breathing desk attendants, I got a manager who attempted to rectify my situation by checking us out. However, they charged us for the full five night stay. When I try to contact the hotel, it is literally impossible to talk to a human. No one cares to answer the phone or respond to any voicemail message. There is literally no way to get in touch with them. Whatever you do stay very far away from this hotel. Management: I implore you to contact me @ meripay@gmail.com ",8/17/18,1
"I spent my 60th birthday weekend in New York with a group of friends, and we chose the ROW NYC based on its location (heart of Times Square) and price (got a great deal on two double rooms). But apparently someone actually noticed that I was celebrating my birthday, and thanks to Karina and her staff, they made it truly special. It wasn't just the courtesy upgrade or the bottle of bubbly they delivered to the room, it was the thought behind it and the attentive service from all the staff that made this a truly magical weekend. From the basic amenities (clean, comfortable room with decent space for your things, courtesy toiletries) to the service (friendly staff) and the amazing location, the ROW delivered. Thank you, ROW for giving me a weekend to remember ",8/17/18,5
"brightening up the hallways, very dark and poor lighting throughout, location was awesome in the art of all the action, staff very friendly and helpful, concierge was extremely helpful in arranging large SUV transportation back to airport. the restaurant staff was not as friendly and donut guy was rud ",8/17/18,3
"Make sure to take advantage of the views!!! I spent almost an hour just watching out of my window. Also the breakfast is amazing, the the chorizo tacos at city kitchen!!!!! The gym on the 3rd floor is amazing as well ",8/17/18,5
"This Hotel is in the heart of mid town and so close to everything. Love the location, and they made it so easy to check in and out. They have an updated system of checking in online and then printing your own keys on arrival. No lines, and it used to be very long lines. The rooms are very clean, and quiet. ",8/17/18,4
"The room I was in was badly maintained. The carpet hat stains on several places and the furniture in the room was damaged. The bathroom had a bad smell originating from the drain and the extractor fan was broken. This room was suppose to be an ""upgrade"" from the standard rooms, however I really doubt that this was an upgrade at all.The rest of the hotel was ok. Internet was average at best and the lifts was quick even at busy times. ",8/17/18,3
"Beautiful area and nice service. But the rooms are very small, absolutely not respecting the pictures provided, and not very clean. Also the rooms are noisy and you can ear everything happening in the nighboor rooms and corridors. With such a location, rooms should be completely different ",8/16/18,2
"The price it charges does not match the quality of the room. It seems overcharged. The facilities are bit old. We paid extra for higher floor for better view. However, we saw all the pipes and ventilation valves. It was disappointing. ",8/16/18,2
"The best part of the hotel was probably the lobby. The rooms weren't clean when we arrived. Sheets where not changed, even when there was an obvious stain on the fitted sheet. Cleaning crew was not professional. Did not restock tissue box or toilet paper ",8/16/18,3
"I have stayed at the Row NYC many times. The location is great, right near Times Square, the subway, the theaters, and Restaurant Row. Check-in is almost always a breeze, regardless of the time I arrive. And the staff is always friendly ",8/16/18,5
"Stayed here for 5 nights and loved every minute,clean and tidy quite modern,requested a upper room for views and got floor 47 was happy enough,very central to Times Square, and do yourself a favour Try out city kitchen and firstly have a burger and secondly try the lobster roll absolutely beaut!! ",8/15/18,5
"First visit and it ranked quite highly. Rooms were cool, clean and well maintained. Location close to the theaters is great. The staff was friendly and helpful. Business area worked well. Wi-Fi very good ",8/15/18,5
"I booked this hotel on Booking.com and loved the outside of the building and when you first walk in. The staff was very nice and knowledgeable. They do check to make sure you have a key to that hotel before you can get on the elevator. Don’t call them after hours “outside the hotel phone” bc no one answers, but maybe they were always busy....who knows lol. The restaurants inside were all awesome! Great location to walk everywhere and subway areas close. It’s literally one sidewalk away from Times Square block.The biggest thing I did not like was waiting at the elevator every single time and there was a crowd/line that was super long every single time. Only certain floors get certain elevators. The building is 30+ stories high, most of the ppl were needing the same elevator. Maybe 9-10ppl at a time could get on without luggage. 5-6 with luggage. They have 8 elevators and our floor (and higher) was only using 2-3 elevators. Maybe just wrong time to go see NYC lol. Parking garage is not at the hotel like it shows when I looked it up. It takes you about 30 min to go one block over to it bc of traffic and ppl (it’s not the hotels PG but they do offer a discounted price for it). It’s on the same side, but on the side so you have to go all the way around bc of one way streets. We left the car there and didn’t use it until we left NYC. Go subway or walk everywhere. Rooms are tiny. Bathroom is super small BUT we didn’t stay much in hotel so it really wasn’t an issue. “Closet” is SUPER tiny so don’t bring many hanging clothing items. View from window was AWESOME. Many different restaurants and shops right there. Last thing but wasn’t a huge deal...you could tell it was a historical building bc the hallways smelled old lol. Rooms smelled better. ",8/15/18,4
"This is a great value for a hotel close to everything you’ll want to see in New York!! You’re a block from any Broadway show, a easy stroll to Central Park and a short subway or cab to Wall Street. The hotel itself has excellent staff that understands customer service. When we come to NYC the Row is our home!! ",8/14/18,5
"My mother, daughter and I recently stayed with Row NYC for an 8 night stay while my daughter took part in a Broadway Dance camp. The room was booked through the camp, so I have no experience with the booking process. We arrived a day late as our flights were cancelled due to weather in the area so we drove overnight to make it in time for camp. We arrived at about 7am on a Saturday morning and at that time there were only a couple of people in line. Check-in went smoothly and quickly. Room keys are kind of cool in that they double as a souvenir luggage tag after your trip. There seems to be quite a few objections about the elevator, but we LOVED it! You type in your floor number and it tells you which elevator to wait for. We found this so efficient, no constantly stopping on floors for people that won't fit in with you. The longest we waited was maybe 5 minutes.Our room was on the 14th floor. Small, but comfortable for us. What would be great is if their beds were elevated so that you can store luggage under them. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom is tiny, but again, nothing we couldn't handle. The view was great.The hotel has both ice machines and water bottle filling machines that also provide hot water. This was perfect for us as we brought along our water bottles so we wouldn't have to pay a premium for water. It would be great if they had mini fridges, but we actually ended up buying a styrofoam cooler from the Food Emporium(about 5 blocks away) to store some things for breakfast. Speaking of food.....its expensive! A yogurt parfait....10.95! We saved ourselves a ton of money by picking up some groceries at the Food Emporium. They also have a buffet that charges $9.99/lb and has a ton of options! I highly recommend walking the few minutes up the road in you want to pinch some pennies!!Location....FANTASTIC! You are so close to everything(especially Times Square and the Theatre District). Central park is about 20 blocks away, Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Centre are also a close walk. The Subway is nearby as well. Easy and cheap to hop on if you want to go see the Statue of Liberty or the 9/11 Memorial. About 10minutes and $6 round trip to get there. Over all, we would stay here again! ",8/14/18,4
The hotel lobby was very busy when I arrived but check in was fairly quick and the staff member was very nice. The room was great for a short stay or 3 nights. Nicely appointed room and bathroom. The bed was surprisingly more comfortable than I had expected since I sleep on a sleep number bed at home I'm a little spoiled about mattress comfort. I would definitely stay here again if I need to stay in the theater district. For the price I was very very happy with the experience.,8/14/18,4
"Overall, our experience was good, not great. For the price we paid for our stay, we expected more, especially with an upgrade to a “premium” room. No fridge was probably the biggest room drawback with food prices in NYC being what they are, so not being able to store any perishables in the room was a drain on our wallets. The biggest drawback is the wait time on elevators during peak hours. They need a professional bellhop or a new algorithm for the elevator assignments. That being said, all of the staff members were friendly and helpful, and the location in the heart of the Theatre District was perfect for access to shows. ",8/14/18,3
This hotel was perfect for the location of the play we were going to see. The theater was just around the corner. The only think i didn't like is that i paid extra to be upgraded and we were put in a handicap room so it seemed we had less space then what i had wanted,8/14/18,4
"Massive elevator problem! Guests can wait for up to twenty minutes each way for the elevator to arrive and even longer if it's raining outside and guests rush in. It was so bad one day that the staff had to transport guests up to their floors in the laundry elevator. Once the elevator took us up to the 18th floor, doors did not open, then it took us back down to the ground floor where we waited another twenty or so minutes for the elevator to arrive! Fix the elevator problem ",8/14/18,3
"The receptionist was not welcoming at all, kept on talking to her colleagues from the other side of the desk before noticing us and didn’t give us any informations or directions. Not what is expected with the room price and especially when you’re coming to a foreign country and that the hotel is the first contact you have with it. Also, payed an extra to have a room with a view but the windows were so dirty that we weren’t even able to see the view properly... A bit disappointed with the service and the room ",8/13/18,3
came for a convention. our first room was disgusting - covered in hair. we had to move.our keys constantly had to be replaced but had to wait in long lines at the desk to get new keys. The mandatory $30 daily fees for phone and wifi should be built into the room charge.the staff was surely. Absolutely a terrible experience,8/13/18,1
"Right next door to the theatre district and Hells Kitchen. Having the 42nd subway station close is also a benefit. Easy walk to times square - so beautiful at night. Room was NYC sized, if you are from Europe it's just like home. Room was slean and well appointed, bathroom nice as well. Wifi is dicey in the rooms and the elevators are, at times, painfully slow. Lots of visitors checking in and out daily make the lobby a bit chaotic but quiet on the floors. Worth a serious look. ",8/13/18,3
"Location is great, very near to everything. Small rooms but comfortable. Helpful security and guards.The staff when I checked in provided ordinary service, no further assistance and even smirked when I asked further questions.The smell of hotel when you enter is good. But the elevator and rooms lobby smelled awful. ",8/13/18,3
"My daughter and I loved this hotel. We had an incredible view that a lovely human being named Junior gave us when he saw that we had a bed too small for our mother, daughter. He gave us two different options, was kind, warm and friendly. We chose the room with the best view. Great room and nice place to stay. ",8/13/18,5
"good service, good price and in the middle of New York. What do you want more. We had a upgrade of our rooms and that was probably one of the best decisions we made. We had five beautiful rooms with our family out of ten people ",8/13/18,5
"It´s an excellent option in NYC, with a high coast benefit! An excellent location, near from Broadway, Times Square and Theater´s streets. The friendly and professional attendance are strong points as well. ",8/13/18,4
"The hotel is in a very good location, rooms are not too big but generally it is an ok place to stay. On the other hand the staff and especially Junior are among the best I have ever talked to!! Amazing amazing and this guy deserves all the best ",8/13/18,5
"Overall, is an average hotel. Good location in the middle of town, near Times Square. Felt like a bit of a hostel at times rather than a hotel. Downstairs lobby was often crowded and disorganised. Staff seemed friendly. Rooms needed renovating, tired and old. Needed a paint and good clean. But was ok enough for a few days business trip. ",8/12/18,3
On check in I was only one in line and was found quickly and given my key. That’s it. Wasn’t handed a brochure on hotel amenities. Wasn’t informed on attached restaurants. No directions on how to use confusing elevators. Nothing. Just handed the key. I had to ask and push the issue. Like pulling teeth to get information. The room was the tiniest I’ve ever seen. Drawers wouldn’t open all of the way because other thing were in the way. The bathroom was tiny and smelled of mold and mildew. The maid service skipped our room twice during our stay. Staff lied to me about a late check out and I had to leave in a hurry because of that lie. They over charged me on my credit card. Horrible experience. Will never recommend or return. For the price you would expect more. They will not do well under these conditions. No repeat business this way. Only first time suckers like me.,8/12/18,1
"Avoid of rooms near to elevator. I had a room close to the elevator for one night and it was terrible. Checking In desk changed me it after the the first nigh and it was very good. Good location, good service, great view (from new room) Take care that your room has window for a Main Street. ",8/12/18,4
"We had a small issue where housekeeping took or threw away a souvenir theater show cup. It was left on the nightstand, not in the trash. We emailed the manager just to let them know so they can train the staff but received no response. If you’re going to offer an email address, we feel there should be a response. Otherwise, room was very small but clean. Location is convenient. Not much of a lobby to hang out in if you like that. Staff was friendly when help asked for. Self check-in required assistance so didn’t save much time. If there was a breakfast no one told us. It was good for our 2-night, lots of theatre visit as we weren’t in hotel much and location worked well. Last, be aware they charge a $30/night facilities fee so that jacks up the online price you see. I’m used to this at resorts, but there weren’t a lot of facilities to justify it ",8/12/18,2
"Room was loud and internet was terrible - make another choice! Bed was tiny, no soap in the bathroom and just a terrible experience. I had stayed here last year and had a much better experience - not sure what changed ",8/12/18,1
Room was very small you just open the door and jumb on the bed . There was no view and when we asked them to change the room theu refused although we stayed for 4 nights.The cleaning service is very poor they took our personal sleepers from our room.We stayed for four nights and they never change the bed sheets during our stay. No profishonal staff on the reception. Breakfast is basic 5 pieces of your selection. very poor the same things every day and if you need a one more piece of fruit its not allowed!,8/12/18,2
"Bad service and small rooms in small hallways in a hotel on crowded Time Square. Generally feels cheap to stay there. Also would not recommend to stay on Time Square, where it is way too busy and nothing original happens. ",8/12/18,3
"The reception Lady was great and super freindaly every thing was great except the breakfast team was unfriendly and rude, they make we feel like we asking for a charity And they are forced to deal with us  ",8/12/18,4
"Very nice location, near time square and subway line.the internet signal didn’t work all the time inside the room. Outside in the lobby it was excellent.Is very organice the elevator to get to your room. The bedroom was always clean, the put lots of towels, everything was perfectly fit.You can have breakfast in the lobby floor, the have classical American breakfast, I will like more healthy option for example fruits.In general is a nice location , easy to go whatever you like, walking or subway .Recomended ",8/11/18,4
"This hotel is located only a block back from Times Square, a few blocks away from major subway stops and basically next to Restaurant Row. The rooms are very small (which would be expected for a hotel room in New York City) and some of the fixtures are ""banged-up"" from frequent use. I also found it strange that in order to access the elevators to the rooms, there was security checking to make sure you had a room key before passing.... regardless, I would still recommend this hotel because of the price and location ",8/11/18,4
"Sad sort of hotel, except for convenience. No fridge nor microwave in room. Can't even request one. District M prices are way overboard. Great location, but that's about it. Elevators are ridiculously slow. I'll look elsewhere for my next trip ",8/11/18,3
The price to experience value for this hotel is significantly higher than other hotels in the Times Square area if you're looking for no frills situation. Shake Shack is a bonus across the street. We've been multiple times with a consistent result,8/11/18,5
"The rooms are extremely small ,not clean, the staff at the pront desk is very unpleasant, you have to wail for the elevators for more then 10 minuets , they charge money for holding packages that are delivered to you, without notifying you before ",8/11/18,1
"A disappointing stay; lucky we weren’t in room much and stay was short, othwise would have changed hotels. The entry smelled of urine, the room was extremely cramped, hidden fees and impersonal check-in. ",8/11/18,1
"When the hotel messes up your reservation they will cite ""hotel policies"" the manager was not kind when helping us with issues that we had. Instead she could barely look us in the eye. There are ways to apologize to customers who had a bad experience, and this hotel instead asserts the rightness of themselves ",8/11/18,1
"the hotel is very well located, just a few blocks behind times square (if you prefer a quiet and calm place, this is not for you). I think they just remodelled the entire building, so the hotel has thousand of apartments and appears to be always crowded. The room was nice, but didn't have a frigobar, which would saved us a lot of time and money. ",8/10/18,3
"Everything was good but no restaurant open to sit and enjoy a meal, everything is closed after 9pm, only a bar but without coffee or desert. After checked out you cannot go to the bathroom because you need a key to access the bathroom on the ground floor. ",8/10/18,4
The hotel is dated. The room is very small. There was not a refrigerator in the room and the bathroom was horrible. It looked like mold was in the shower. The water pressure was very slow. I could barely turn around in the bathroom,8/10/18,2
"I’ve stayed at The Row four or five times and think it’s a great find. It’s in the heart of all the energy of Times Square, but provides a peaceful retreat. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I’ll keep coming back ",8/10/18,5
"The Row is a great place to stay if you want a relative inexpensive room near Times Square. The rooms are small but that is typical in NYC. There is food service concessions with a wide variety of food choices. The ADA rooms are not up to standard, i.e. not high toilet, no room around bed, and low mattress ",8/10/18,4
"Very pleased with all aspects of this hotel!! Room may have been a bit small but it was well designed, clean and oh so blissfully cool in August! Love a place with great air conditioning! Elevator system was genius so we had no wait shooting up to the 15th floor! Security was on site so we felt safe and having Sugar Factory was a great plus right off the lobby. Walk to Times Square was perfect - would stay here again in a New York minute (sorry, couldn't resist that! ",8/9/18,5
The room is fine even if a bit old fashionRoom service is efficient but restaurant / breakfast place is really too small especially when some groups arrive ( it seems a lot in this hotel)Whatever room are very quite,8/9/18,3
"We visited the hotel for 6 nights, a couple and a baby. No doubt the hotel has a great location. Yet, the hotel simply isn't good and isn't worth the money. The rooms are incredibly small, even for a Manhattan hotel room, everything that is provided regularly is hotel was provided for extra money (fridge for example costs 35 dollars). The elevators are super slow and the worst part is the way the staff treated us. We had a flight at midnight and we were with a baby. In addition to that, I was sick, but the hotel staff weren't willing to allow us a later checkout. It was a very disappointing experience ",8/9/18,2
Good old fashioned communication skills lacking by frontcreception staff. They can be rude and abrasive. If they're busy they're worse. Management need to invest in some communication skills training. And a little cultural awareness training would be good! Not everyone appreciates the NY abrasivenes,8/9/18,2
"An old building , the location close to T Square very good specially if you have view to 8th Avenue. Very comfortable the bed. In the bathroom soap was missing. Quite place to rest. I would suggest to use more lights in the hotel especially at the corridors was dar ",8/9/18,3
Ideal location in Times Square  within walking distance of many good food places  easy to Uber further out if desired  near many theaters. Easy to get about with no car. Room and bathroom were very clean. Felt safe. Nice modern decor.,8/9/18,5
"This hotel is conveniently located for theater goers. Room was efficiently laid out, so even though it was small (which we expected in NYC) it was comfortable. We were happy with the hotel and would stay again ",8/8/18,5
"Went on vacation with my family and was referred by a friend to stay at this hotel. Excellent location, service and security. Staff was very helpful and the room was very clean. Will definitely recommend. ",8/8/18,5
"Room very small and dirty, very noisy and rowdy wouldn’t recommend for families or traveling alone as we didn’t feel safe but a great location otherwise. Staff very helpful on checking in and at breakfast bar. ",8/8/18,2
"Over all nice hotel. Great location, clean, basic amenities. The continental breakfast included in our fee was good. Would be nice to have coffee maker in room. They offer filtered water with collaspable water bottle, but water not available on every floor. Since not on our floor, had to go up 1 floor via elevator - so are waiting for availability. You cannot take the stairs because you will be locked out of your floor - no key pad to re-enter with key. Very good service, security, nice bar / breakfast ",8/8/18,4
"Review already written and rated in previous page. Overall worst, AC has noice so that no one can sleep. Wash rooms are tiny, lavatory is for kids and tubs are for 10kg kids as they hardy bare the weight. Beds were too small but in photos looked bigger. Room service was called for almost 5 times but still the room was cleaned for 2 times in 7 days trip. Reception was totally incorporative. Lifts and dark floors with dim lights on the floor were horrible. ",8/8/18,1
"For me, is very important to share special moments with my soulmate, in our favorite city! New York is a magic city! Our feeling is like the living in a movie all the time!! Join us in a rooftop happy hour looking to Manhattan ",8/8/18,5
"From the moment we started check-in with Junior, we felt like ROW is our second home. (Our NYC home) Yay! He was so kind, professional and gave us many tips about the city! We are so thankful to feel this way as many times we feel like just a number when arriving at a hotel. But here we felt SO WelcomE! Thank you Junior! You're outstanding! Best location, convenience with hotel amenities. We will come back many and many times ",8/8/18,5
Had a bit of a mishap with my booking through the call centre. But it was sorted after they listened to the call. I was upgraded and they kept their end of the deal. Overall good stay. Breakfast was a bit disappointing.,8/8/18,4
"Great hotel for dancers studying at Broadway dance--seeing Broadway and Off-Broadway Shows. Good restaurants around. Easy corner property for going anywhere. Staff friendly, what's not to love. Happy kids ",8/8/18,4
"Great Hotel great staff and location we had a nice view too which helps. The hotel was clean tidy and modern had a little shop and great selection of food eateries inside, plus nice bar. The room was a bit small but the bed was comfy so that's all that counts after a hard days walking ",8/8/18,4
"This hotel is in a great location. I generally had a good experience here, the staff were all very attentive and friendly! The only thing I would say is that the rooms are a little small, and it wasn't a cheap hotel, I also found the hallways a little dark and dingy but I think this is what they were going for. I would return if I needed to but it would not be my first choice ",8/8/18,4
"The cleanliness and customer service of this hotel was one of the worst that I've came across. The room was grubby and had hair from the previous occupant still in the bath tub and sink area. On the last day I found an invoice for Facilities charge posted under my door, $25 per night! So it didn't turn out to be a cheap place to stay. The area of the hotel is a very busy area with a lot of street noise at all times. The only bonuses of the Hotel is that the lobby smells and looks nice, the room offers a free safe and the location is close to times square ",8/8/18,1
This hotel located in an excellent spot to get to the heart of the scene. Most theaters are around and many things to see are close. The hotel lobby and reception are busy all times and it gives a feeling of a train station. The bar is excellent so the coffee at the bar. The “kitchen “ serves good breakfast and tasty pastries. The room is so poor that you don’t want to be there. The elevator is smelly and hot- no air conditioner,8/7/18,1
"This place is only worth it if you want to stay somewhere near Times Square. If you’re looking for quality in any other areas, don’t stay here. Customer service was bad. The guy didn’t want to help split our tab because it would take too long. Then people who I emailed for information gave me different information than the people at the front desk. The front desk told us we get two FREE drinks of prosecco each night, but they charged us for it! The only good customer service were from housekeeping as they greeted us every time. The beds weren’t as comfortable and the rooms were very small. The hallways were gross, dark, and smelled like mildew. The elevators always had some kind of stench to it and they were sooo small. ",8/7/18,2
"We had problems in the cleaning of the room, since we found dirty with condoms between the bed and the bureau, the next day we did not have towels and it took more than an hour to upload them, the staff very rude and little attention from the manage ",8/7/18,3
"As stated previously, the bed in room 1010 needs to be changed or turned or something. It's a lopsided mattress now and very uncomfortable. Otherwise the entire facility was very comfortable and convenient ",8/7/18,5
"Location, location, location! Seriously great for walking to everything. Centrally located near great restaurants, theatre and all the fun of Times Square. Super fun photo machine in lobby, crazy candy sho ",8/7/18,5
"Overall great! Check in was terrible and initial room was not very clean, but staff remedied very quickly and room cleanliness was excellent and service was amazing by the management team. I would recommend staying in Row if you want to stay in heart of Times square with your family. ",8/7/18,4
"The room was on the small side, and the decor was industrial-looking. The bed was comfortable, the A/C was fine, and the internet was good. Considering that we weren't planning to spend much time in the room, it was fine, and a good value ",8/7/18,4
Worst stay ever! They basically ruined my first New York experience. Room service is very slow if any! They charged us for receiving a parcel ahead of time and never informed us! Took them forever to provide me with my parcels! Charged our credit card for the stay without asking if we would like to pay in cash or credit,8/7/18,1
I have been staying at ROW NYC since 2015 every time I work in the City. I love the crisp look in the rooms. The easy access to a variety of delicious food in City Kitchen is great and unique. The friendly staff is a plus,8/6/18,5
"The room contains bed covers with stains. When calling front desk/staff, they said they will resolve the issue by bringing new covers and etc. After hours of waiting and multiple phone calls, they did not resolve the issue and stopped answering their number. At midnight, I walked around the hotel looking for house keeping and did not find anyone. In the end, I had to resolve the issue by myself by going into house keepings room to retrieve new bed sheets and cover. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. ",8/6/18,1
The room and bathroom are small as stated in other reviews. The lobby is really nice and chic. Check in was quick and the hotel staff was friendly. There is a baggage room to leave your suitcases until the room is available.,8/6/18,3
Dont waste your money on this hotel. Its definitely a tourist trap. it was quickly renovated and thrown together. Quality and service is horrible. You will be waiting hours to do anything in the hote,8/6/18,1
"Surface clean only, dark and dim hallways and rooms. Check-in took over 30 minutes as understaffed. iPad check-ins were not working. In room AC unit was very loud. Wouldn't stay again. Though, location was great ",8/6/18,2
"The bathroom was covered in hair from the previous guest, all over the sink and shower. The sheets were also dirty, we found stains all over. It was clearly cleaned in a rush or not at all. We unfortunately discovered this very late in the evening and felt that nothing would be done at that hour since it wasn’t even taken care of before we checked in. The location was good, but the room was just so dirty I would definitely look to stay somewhere else next time. ",8/6/18,1
"Our room had black mildew around the tub, no short curtain upon check in, dirty windows, dusty window ledge. We had to slam our door to make sure it was closed. Our view was blocked by a wall so we couldn’t see Times Square which was disappointing. Our friends stayed a few floors up and had a wonderful view for the same rate. It would be nice to have a water station in each floor. We had a ask for the water bottles. It was very convenient to store luggage after check out and the female bartender was very nice at Club M. The first floor bathrooms and luggage storage area was updated unlike the rest of the hotel. It was located in a very convenient location. ",8/6/18,3
"You could't pay me to stay here. The rooms were filthy. I had to change rooms. Hair and stains on the mattress, bathroom dirty, stains on walls...dark hallways....just not a great experience. Staff were nice but clearly dealing with a number of issues whenever I was at reception.. ",8/6/18,1
"on the pictures it looks very nice but in reality I do not think so. It is a good location, in the middle of the Timesquare but I think there is not special. I did not like the hygiene, the bedding was not always clean stains had, the room was cleaned only superficially, bathroom was too narrow. For the price we paid, I am disappointed. The service was reasonably okay ",8/6/18,2
"rude staff, smelly lobby, small room with hardly any basic amenities. Motel feel in Hotel skin. Ive traveled the world and stayed in many different hotels. I just couldnt believe how bad my experience was. There are no excuses for this. Will never stay here again and will not recommend. in fact, i will discourage anyone to stay here. ",8/6/18,1
I have stayed at this hotel a few times. Every time I returned it was better than the time before. The staff in District M were wonderful. My sister dropped something that was in her purse. She didn't realized she had dropped it. They went out of their way to find our room and returned the item. We appreciated their kindness,8/5/18,5
"I’ve never left a hotel review before, and consider myself a person who can look past a few things that go wrong. But after this experience, I had to write a review. First, it’s a great location. Right off of Times Square, and we were able to walk to our shows and a lot of places easily. We expected the room to be small, but it felt much smaller than the website pictures felt. There was a miscommunication about our room, so they had to move us, and when they moved us, we went into our new room to find the bed unmade, sheets on the floor and desk, and garbage on the floor. We went back to the desk and they waived 2 nights of the $30 a night hotel extra fee. We appreciated that. In our new room, we called down for pillows. We called 12 times and no one ever picked up the phone, so over the course of 2 days, we had to go down to the front desk 5 seperate times and were always assured that they would be up soon. I’ve never experienced such a lack of customer service. The smell in our room was quite bad. It smelled like...just a bad smell. Old and damp. But then it started to smell like smoke, which I’m allergic to. I called the desk a few times and no one answered again. I went down to talk to someone and she said they’d check into it. I never heard back. It was such a disappointing experience and I unfortunately wouldn’t recommend based on that. ",8/5/18,1
Absolutely dreadful. Air conditioning didn't work and there was a dried blood stain on my bed sheet. I sent a photo of it to the NY health department. Front desk staff were nice and tried to help as much as they could. They did adjust my bill.,8/5/18,1
"I’ve 3 times in NYC and it was my second at the Row NYC. The reasons I always go to the Row when I’m going to New York is for the amazing location (one street/avenue away from Times Square), for the awesome restaurants (City Kitchen) in the hotel, for the sympathy of the personal, for the beautiful decoration of the hotel, and the hotel is so clean and it smell so good when you go in. That kind of little details is the way you come back! I really recommend you guys that hotel. One of the best in NYC. Always happy in New York at The Row! I can’t wait for the next time! ",8/5/18,4
NYC vacation was awesome with all family together tracking and discovering each famous places in New York city.The hotel has a great place... in the center of entertainment. Not far for have a lunch and dinner with good price,8/5/18,4
"This hotel is a steal for those looking for a convenient place to stay when seeing shows. It’s smack in the middle of the Theater District and you can see marquees from your room. It’s pretty clean, very chic, and always bustling, which might be the challenge. There are so many people in this area all the time, so be ready to fight your way through the crowd trying to come in ",8/5/18,4
"Right in heart of theatre district , subway,Times square. Room was small but well appointed and very clean. Will use this hotel again. Very easy checkin on phone before arriving. We even had our room number before we got there. We arrived late morning and checkin time was 4 pm, but I had asked for early checkin and we were in our room before noon. ",8/5/18,5

"Excellent location. Great teaser rate. Tiny rooms with tiny beds and a sizable charge for a bed ""upgrade."" Lobby crowded and just worn out. What was unacceptable and why I will not stay there again is a hidden $30 per day ""facilities"" fee for such things as phone and TV, and services I never used like the gym. Bull ",8/5/18,2
"Great location, service great, cleanliness great and choices of food in area is unlimited!!! If purchase your reservation online and choose to upgrade, how can you tell the difference between superior vs standard. ",8/4/18,3
We stayed 4 nights in a tiny modest old and not clean hotel. The hotel looks and feels like a train station- people coming and going all day. The lobby is noisy.the staff at the reception are not welcoming and nice. ( how can they with so many people)The room itself doesn’t give a feeling of a hotel room..on top of all i found a bug in the room. Complaining to the manager hasn’t helpedThe bar is nice. Good coffee .,8/3/18,1
Super noisy room from outside AC unit. Toenail clippings on toilet. Overpriced breakfast. Horrible internet connection. Great location. This survey is redundant and requires me to expound on my crappy experience for 200 words.,8/3/18,1

"Very small rooms but the location of the Hotel worths. Exceptional location if you want a hotel only for sleeping, also the row hotel is the main stop of the bus that take you to the woodbury premium outle ",8/3/18,4
"I don't have time to include all the items that went wrong or were not what I was led to believe.The resort tax is ridiculous. These are for amenities that most quality hotels give you for free.The hallways to my room were littered with dirty laundry carts parked in front of my door. The ice machine was on the other side and created a racket all hours of the night. The bedlinens were never changed during my entire stay. And while in the past I have received coupons for a drink or food and rewards ($5 credit for Starbucks, etc.) none were offered.I am posting my complaints on Trip Advisor. I don't plan to revisit ROW even though I goto NYC at least 3 times a year and stay from 3-5 days each visit. Adios, ROW ",8/3/18,2
Caesar at check in was quick friendly and helpful. Brisbane the bellman was amazing and friendly and efficient. The location of this hotel was amazing...in the middle of everything. I recommend it for that reason alone. Handicap accessible rooms are much larger than the other rooms which looked insanely small,8/3/18,4
Stay away. First three floors are displaced homeless people. Their kids are all over the place. The floors smell like curry in a hurry and other. All carpeted with dirty and not kept carpet. Not vacuumed in god knows how long. Room smelled. They changed it upon request to a less smelly room. A guest told me that in the morning the halls are lined with garbage from take out food and beverages. The staff is trying but you can’t shine poop. Just stay away. YMCA is probably better.,8/3/18,1
"Awkward facilities, restrooms for the lounge and food court require room key or code, and the guy at the elevator lobby nagging people to show a room key certainly didn't make me feel safe or welcome. The room was shabby and poorly maintained. The bathroom had nowhere to hang towels, and not even a soap dish in the shower, The air conditioner was loud, but at least it drowned out the noise of other rooms and the street. The bed had the worst mattress I've ever seen ",8/2/18,2

"Was looking for the little escape from routine and mini-vacation. The location of the hotel is great, right by the Times Square. It has a food court that provides wonderful options for breakfast and quick bites if you are more sightseeing oriented and always run everywhere. The hotel staff was nice and friendly, specifically the gentleman who helped me out even when only 4-5 minutes of his shift left, greatly appreciated. Housekeeping did an excellent job. When i was checking out, couple minutes late, trying to close my suitcase, the housekeeping lady was patiently waiting for me outside :D Perfect hotel for those who want to be in comfort and feel welcomed when coming back tired from the busy day and having everything around you while on the trip ",8/2/18,5
smallest elevator in the world. have to pay $20 for extra hour for late check out. shower curtain in the bathroom is way too short which means everything gets wet. room keys fail to work 80% of the time. did i mention there were two cockroaches in the bedroom leisurely walking by the window and by the floor,8/2/18,1
Average hotel. A bit pricey for the hotel. Door men were lacking. Room was not overly clean. We had to ask for washclothes everyday. You couldn’t get guest servicesTo even answer the phone. Front desk rud,8/2/18,3
"In a previous review I referred to a room fit for ""Cousin It"" from the Adams Family TV show because it was so small. Well, I found one even smaller at ROW NYC Hotel. It measured 11 feet, by 8 feet. No lie!!! (Room 2626). This particular property has incredibly slick advertising and pictures on its website that have no basis in reality what-so-ever. ROW NYC is a tired under-maintained property that is a wonderful revenue generator for its owners. The Facilities Fee is poorly disclosed at best, and because it's in NYC, you pay additional tax on it, so it's really $34.32. And this fee represented a 23.6% premium on the room charge I was quoted. This is meaningful, as we say in business.Now what this Facility Fee got me is still a mystery. Collapsible branded water bottles??? I don't want them. Sorry, pay the fee. So the quick review is: small noisy rooms, no AC in the halls, primitive elevators and scam fees.To those people visiting from outside the USA, please do not judge us by this hotel ",8/2/18,1
"Great location. And good room for sleep. Good price compare to others in the area. will stay again no problem. close to any train stations and buses too. Cabs, food,times square, broadway. Love the area ",8/2/18,5
Staff was helpful on showing you directions and you get a discount on parking. The bed was small and they insisted it was a queen.?! It was also uncomfortable. You are close enough to time square but you do not hear the noise from the 23rd floor.,8/2/18,3
"My sister and I went into the city for a 4-day/3-night stay. We stayed at the ROW on 8th Avenue. Even though it was an old hotel and the rooms a bit small, it was redone in a very tasteful way. They guy at the front desk offered us 2 choices--one room was a standard, but a bit small--even though it was beautifully decorated. The other room, according to him was bigger; but, had no view because of the AC unit. We chose the bigger room, which was very nicely done. Everything was upgraded, from the lamps to the bathroom. Also, they provided us with a refrigerator upon request. I liked how they had the murals artfully done on different doors and walls. And, even in the room, the murals were very tastefully done with pictures of everyday life in NYC. Within the hotel was a lot of places to get food and hang out. It was always crowded and hopping, even though we didn't really hang or hop during late hours. Overall, the staff was great and the accommodations was pretty good for the price. ",8/1/18,5
"Service was less than great... wasn’t able to check in until around 6:30pm, front desk couldn’t be bothered to even attempt to get me an early check-in. Rooms seemed rundown and cheap. Charged an extra fee that was not listed when I booked through hotel.com. Sneaky way to misrepresent a lower price. Surprise $60 charge was less than ideal. Bottom line is I would not stay here again. ",8/1/18,3
"For the price we received (booking.com) you can't beat it! Great location, nice staff, rooms were clean, bed was comfortable, for us it was a great stay with zero complaints. I'd definitely stay here again if the need arrises and would definitely recommend to others as well. ",8/1/18,5
"I found the room which was a twin very small compared with other rooms I have had in USA, and there is no fridge which was a shame. The location however if great, 5 minutes walk from Times Square. Bathroom needs updating but was functional, the air conditioning worked well. We checked in pretty quickly and had to pay a resort fee of approx £20 per night. The hotel has free WiFi. Certainly not luxury but we didn’t spend a great deal of time in the room ",8/1/18,3
"On checking in I requested a ‘quieter’ room if available. The room was tucked away in a corner away from other guest noise but whatever it was next too sounded as though I had a train coming through all night long. I got no sleep, then found I was starting my day with a cold shower (NO hot water) and a hairdryer that didn’t work. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Sadly this is the first time other Trip Advisor reviews have let me down in helping to make a choice ",8/1/18,1
Nice location the place to beGood service clean good value for New York City very nice roomNot to noisy if you have the chance to stay up to floor 12One block from time square A large choice of restaurant in the neighborhood,7/31/18,4
Clean the rooms go check behind the bed and the wall in room 2634 dust balls old hair old gum inches of dust literally and maybe renovate it there is no space to walk in the rooms and improve the elevators they are the worst things about your hotel. Waited 5 min just to get to the lobby. The room i paid for and saw pics of wasnt what i got how sad is that and front desk said i had the right room. Bathroom way too small and smelt horrible old sewer smell hairs were in the tub when we arrived my girlfriend was disgusted by the whole room. We ended up not wanted room cleaning because we new it would just be a bed made and new towels. the bellman didnt even help me with my bags he just flirted with every woman walking by. Good location everything else ruins the hotel stagf isnt the greatest ethier front desk checking out the guy had major attitude. Not towards us but he just wasnt in the mood to answer any questions we had and its just fustrating due to the fact i paid for this hotel before and stayed everything was great but this time everything went downhill and now i really wont be comming back. The RIU seems to be my next NYC hotel stay,7/31/18,1
Clean spacious room with friendly staff and in a great location if you plan to go see some broadway shows - also really close to restaurant row. I was only slightly disappointed there was no re-usable cups (only plastic.. which isn't great environmentally speaking) or hot water facilities - also shower took 10 minutes to get warm,7/31/18,4
"Standard rooms are extremely small and upgrades have to be paid for. However...if all you need is a place to sleep and rest, this property is a very good choice!! Clean, convenient and modern. Conveniently located in the heart of the city with Broadway and night life at your fingertips. Be aware that the bathrooms are a real squeeze.... especially the toilet area! ",7/31/18,4
"Row NYC is located in the heart close to Times Square and all the public transport hubs of Port Authority, Penn Station and in close proximity or walking distances to most attractions. The hotel reception is not your conventional type reception. Very quirky but staff were pleasant and helpful. The rooms are clean and the housekeeping staff are an asset to the establishment as the rooms are well maintained. There is no fridge or tea/coffee facilities in the room. You are given a plastic type sort container which you can avail yourself of water refills at the many stations situated within the complex's floors. Wifi connection was great. Rooms and bathrooms are very tiny but I expect being a major tourist hub, it's common. The gym is adequate, with towels and a water station provided, however, a suggestion would be to update or repair some of the equipment. TV and aircon in the room was great. Toiletries and soaps provided daily. My main disappointment was the fact that you pay a resort fee which is charging you for the wifi, 'bottled water' and gym facilities. I understand with most countries, especially in Europe you only pay a city tax which is about $2:00 a day. Maybe, add the resort fee within the price of the hotel room. A suggestion as people may not use the gym, or wifi etc. Otherwise, I cannot fault your establishment. Was a great stay. ",7/31/18,4
If you are going to see a lot of Broadway shows - you can NOT beat this location. It is literally in the heart of the theater district. You can walk to all the major shows in a matter of minutes. The price is excellent too. The rooms are small - but very quiet - excellent for sleeping! AC works great too,7/31/18,5
"We had a great 6 day stay at this hotel. The location is great for all of the Times Square and Central Park activity. The room was large by NYC standards. The food court is a nice touch, and the option for breakfast with your stay helped was nice. Security at the elevator bank in the evening was nice. I will stay here again ",7/31/18,5
"This hotel is at 1 block of time square so the location is excellent, my room was quite calm (we cannot heard the noise of time square from the room) so it was an hotel with a good price quality ratio.The room is not so large (~20 m²) but for 2 people with 2 luggages it is ok. ",7/31/18,4
"They charged me a lot more than agreed with booking without giving me explanations and without me knowing, I felt cheated. When I arrived they did not have my room, they did not offer me to keep my bags or just wait three hours for me to have the room ready or give me another one, I was not going to imagine that they would put me in a dirty room that looked out onto a patio a giant turbine. Then I went to complain because the noise of the turbine was impossible not slept all night and they happened to put me in a room with better views but in front of the ice machine, which was heard as they used at night, I do not understand what walls they have so that everything is heard. It took more than 15 minutes to get on the elevator to get to the room, waiting queue to access the elevator. It was horrible they did not fulfill anything that I agreed to when booking ",7/30/18,1
"My wife got a groupon for this hotel, but you get what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend staying here if you can afford a step up. The hotel is trying to be a modern, hip hotel with nice bar, but once you get in the elevator it's 1972 and the hotel is called Milford Plaza. The rooms are small, but average for NYC. The amenities are pretty good. The bed we had was in need of a replacement. The windows are single pane, every dump truck, siren, motorcycle, bus, drunk, who is within 100 feet of the hotel can be heard....all...night....long. But for those who get cheap rooms, you should run if the number is X11 X10 X09 as they are next to the ice machine that can be heard very, very well in the room. This is a major annoyance as our night we heard people get 2-3 pounds of ice every 10-15 minutes from 11pm until 1:30am. Who needs ice at the time of the night?Avoid ",7/30/18,2
"We leave the airport and we arrive by subway. The hotel is very well located in the 8th Avenue, near from the bus station Port Authotity. The room was simple and good. Junior and Yara were excellent, very helpful and friendly! Always willing to help with anything ",7/30/18,5
"Old Hotel This hotel needs serious renovations. Carpets, elevator system, phones, TV’s, windows, rooms way to small for two small people let alone average people, bathrooms need face lift, coffee makers would be nice, water and ice on different floors so a 30 minute trip was required for drinkable water because of elevator system. Only positive was location. So if you don’t require sleep in a relatively quiet room with a bed big enough for two (seriously not enough floor space for one person to sleep on) don’t bring more than one suitcase as there is no room to put it anywhere. By far the smallest hotel room I have ever seen . ",7/30/18,2
"Great location near Time square walking distance. The Row had Food and bar on-site happy hour ended at 8PM. The rooms were quiet and The Channels were a good selection. I didn't use the gym or internet, but I think they would have been good too. ",7/30/18,3
We have been for 8 nights staying at the hotel. The wheelchair accessibility was really ok. The ada rooms are small but accessible. In general the hotel is not great. We had room on 25th floor and the noise from the street was crazy. The air conditioner was too noisy. The waiting for the elevator was disturbing.,7/30/18,2
"The best thing about this hotel is that it is located near Broadway and Time Square. That’s really where the positives end. The rooms were very small (even by NY standard) and equally as dirty. There was peeling paint, dislodged baseboards, and dust everywhere... even on the TV remote. The carpet looked as if it hadn’t been cleaned or vacuumed in years. The average wait for an elevator is about 15 minutes and the wait to check in was twice that even though we arrived during a slow period. The hotel charges a daily “resort fee” for parking and WiFi even if you aren’t parking a vehicle. The WiFi is spotty, at best. I’ve been to NYC dozens of times and this was by far the worst hotel I’ve booked ",7/30/18,2
"For the location I got the bang for my buck here at the Row Hotel. For the service from the staff, this place was impeccable. However, the room size and the uncleanliness of the guest room was very disappointing. I would stay there again but only if they could guarantee that I wouldn't have to be afraid to take my shoes off. ",7/30/18,2
"Really basic - nothing great about this hotel. Room just barely cleanvery noisy (its new york yes, but the insolation is really poor)... service charge expensive, so yes the romm is cheaper than othe rhotel, but when you had the 35usd service its not worth i ",7/30/18,3
"This hotel was fantastic, made it super easy and were super accommodating! I would for sure stay here again, and maybe even for longer! From the moment I walked in, to the super easy check out process! Great! ",7/29/18,5
"ROW NYC is perfectly located to take in the theatre and shows, and is close enough to Times Square for those who desire that experience. But with the exception of the lobby, the building is dark, dank and dated. The windows are not sound-proof, so the noise from 8th as well as 44th and 45th waft up and permeate even the most upper floors. There were consistent foul smells particularly within the general hall areas. It would benefit from a serious upgrade and facelift. The staff is pleasant but not polished ",7/29/18,2
"Was there for only one night when airline cancelled my flight. Stayed in nicer hotels in the same price range earlier in the trip. Poor service at check in, understaffed front desk. Elevator system is confusing. Do help available to get my bags to the room ",7/29/18,3
"This hotel was easily accessible-just steps away from our subway stop! Due to availability we were able to check in and head to our spacious room early. The environmentally friendly, collapsible water bottles provided at check in were super handy for the fresh water center on our floor (which kept us hydrated in the summer heat!) Kitchen M, attached to the hotel had a great assortment of grab and go food items, made to order. Delicious! A great place to stay if you want to be steps away from theater and restaurants ",7/29/18,5
"This is a great hotel for the price. The smart elevators are really fast so we never waited at all, which was nice. Nice little cafe/bar area, and the online check in had our room ready super early. The room was basic but decent and had a nice view, and it’s located really close to broadway. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend ",7/29/18,5
I felt let down. Did not enjoy the experience in the hotel. The Staff were very good friendly and accommodating. Helped with advice and booking shows. It was the hotel itself that I was not happy with considering I paid over 2000 dollars.,7/29/18,3
Enjoyed our four night stay with my daughter who was attending a theater camp. Hotel was in convenient location in time square close to broadway and in time square. Bed was very comfortable. Rooms were small but clean and updated. Great cafe in hotel with lots of quick food choices. Many great restaurants close by. I would return again,7/29/18,4
Great location in the middle of everything. Modern and very clean room. Bar/lounge was chic and comfortable. Great atmosphere and friendly and helpful staff. Will definitely consider ROW NYC on my next trip to the city,7/29/18,5
"I don’t leave a lot of reviews even though I travel frequently. But I felt the need to write this after witnessing first hand how horrible this place is. My daughter and I planned a trip to NYC. I selected a hotel and so did she. After we checked out of the first hotel we checked into the hotel she selected which unfortunately was The Row NYC. I tried to be positive after reading the reviews. The negative reviews do not lie. How this place gets away with charging people so much money for a dump I don’t know. First, Upon entering our room we noticed a long piece of metal just laying around. It looked like it had broken off from their cheap dresser. Major safety hazard. If you would have little ones they would have cut themselves on this sharp piece of metal. Second, a pubic hair was on top of their torn sheet that they use as a comforter/bedspread. Third, mirror was not cleaned, tons of fingerprints. Fourth, the yellow sliding door for their bathroom has never been cleaned. Fifth they reuse the shampoos. Sixth, the toilet seat was damaged. Seventh windows look like they have never been cleaned. Eighth, damage furniture. This place is disgusting, dirty and should be labeled as a motel or hostel. Walls are paper thin. There is no safety door for the adjoining room. So you can hear every movement, noise and door closures. If you pay so much money you deserve a clean safe room. This is not acceptable. Row NYC you truly need to take care of your property and inspect the cleaning and safety of each room. You easily take the consumers money and charge ridiculous fees for what? Invest in your property! If you care about where you stay be warned ",7/28/18,1
"Even superior room is small, too noisy from surroundings, not clear floors and elevators. Hot water and ice machine are separately on even and odd floors, walk a lot distance. Sound insulation between rooms are bad. Rooms are terribly tightly compact ",7/28/18,2
"I stayed 1 night at the Row hotel and the price was reasonable for the location. The room was clean, functional but very tiny.The elevator system was horrible. It took me about 20-25 minutes to reach the room. Overall, the experience was okay but not great ",7/28/18,3
"Very friendly and helpful staff, from check-in to check-out and luggage storage on our last day. There was a little mix up in the type of rooms we wanted, and the woman who checked us in quickly arranged for the room we had requested and also called someone right then to ask them to look into the reservation system that allowed the error. That took all of 2 minutes to fix, not a problem at all! Rooms were clean, beds were comfortable, size was just fine, bathrooms were clean with lots of hot water and good water pressure. We were looking for a a nice place to sleep, not a luxury room to hang out in. We didn't come to NYC to hang out in the hotel room! We were on the 25th floor and the room was quiet both from outside noise and within the hotel. The location is wonderful, with a subway station steps away at the corner, great restaurants within a minute's walk, Times Square down the block, and too many theaters to count. I stayed here 7 years ago during their renovation and am glad that I chose the Row NYC again ",7/28/18,5
"The location is ideal, three blocks from Time Square and across the street from the subway. Five minute walk to the theater, bowling and Juniors Restaurant. The hotel has several restaurants inside, they serve good breakfast and donuts, also great view while you eat. I would definitely stay at this location again. It is on 8th ave. between 43rd and 44th st ",7/28/18,5
"This place is a good price for it's location. If you just want a place to stay for cheaper and you're not too picky I would stay here. But, if you are picky about certain things like, amenities, space, and over the top cleanliness do not stay here. The staff was all very nice, aside from 2 concierge's who were pretty rude. The elevator situation is awful. The building is so old that it seems they just cant clean it well, like our bathroom had black stuff (not mold) in all the corners, and the carpet is gross. There are no fridge's in the tiny rooms. The WIFI is actually great, that is a plus. I was there for six days and it was bareable, but is not luxury by any means. ",7/28/18,3
"Good relation between cost and benefit. Very small room to accomodate four persons, but an excelent location, near subway station and atractions such as Times Square, Central Park and Broadway Theatres. ",7/28/18,4
"Excellent option to stay in NY... close of everything, very good service, comfortable and clean rooms, good breakfast... is ubicated in the heart of Manhattan... In my personal opinion one of the best!! ",7/28/18,5
"Booked a room online thinking the pictures showed a nice room . Well it’s not , room is disgusting and all the other amenities they boast about our dingy . Staff is sketchy , cleanliness isn’t a word here . I immediately payed for a night but left as soon as I saw my room . Save your money don’t goooo. It’s nasty don’t go ! I repeat don’t go ! ",7/28/18,1
The staff was helpful  the room ice and tidy. The hotel room could have been $50 less expensive: that would make up for what is a nice stay but not at $300. I found the concierge service to be totally up to par,7/28/18,4
"Room quite small as always in NY . Nearby Times Square in a perfect location to walk around midtown. Biggest issue is the noise from outside but expecially from the fan. During the night I had to turn it off. Haven't understood why I had to pay 30$ extra over the bill for ""facilities "" ",7/28/18,3
This hotel is a great location in Times Square. It is very convenient to most tourist attractions. The staff was very helpful in getting us to the location for a subway. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to New York.,7/27/18,5
"I went to nyc for business as I typically do. row nyc was a better option for the area I was working in. The rooms were smaller than usual and the hotel lobby was a little worn. I think there are many other BETTER options in nyc for the price point (around $250/night) for July. Everything together, my opinion is 3 stars. Staff was mostly friendly (concierge guys was standoffish)- room- though small- was clean. I did have a nicer view than typical. Give it a try if you need to be in the area. ",7/27/18,3
"I've stayed at ROW NYC many times - terrific location, helpful and friendly staff. Solid value and great for business travel. Very comfortable and spacious rooms. Easy access to public transportation ",7/27/18,5
"Great location, good deal on room and parking, elevators were BAD! Only 2 elevators for floors greater then 13. Wait time VERY long! 3 times we were taken to the service elevator by staff. Staff was very helpful ",7/27/18,4
"That's a great hotel to visit when you visit the big apple, aka New York City. It's location is just a few blocks from the famous Times Square and it's a great place to stay. Totally recommended of course ",7/27/18,5
Be careful of what they give you for a room very small room. Location is great Room was next to the elevator shaft so the noise was horrible. I got screwed because I chose the online internet priceThe hotel staff didn't care this room 1532 should never be given out. I contacted the mgr. he never called me back. I had to call 3 times to get extra pillows No one at the hotel cares about customer servic,7/27/18,2
"The hotel is in easy access to the town centre and is quite easy to find, upon arrival there was a nice warm welcome, and the rooms are very well laid out, everything you need to hand, most impressive was the little fridge with complimentary bottled water and a safe! The only criticism about this hotel would maybe only be the maybe the decor could be a little brighter but that would be a minor issue, other than that an excellent stay, and also the food served was 100% for presentation and taste! Would recommend a try ",7/27/18,5
"I come to NY several time per year. i love to stay at the Row NYC hotel: very convenient to Times Square, clean room, friendly staff. The food court offer a great variety of good food at convenient prices. Nothing elese to write: just an excellent hotel where to stay ",7/26/18,5
"ROOM 1637We booked this room on Hotwire so we weren't sure what to expect. Pros:-We were thrilled with the location, right in the heart of Times Square! -Fast/early check in-Comfortable, clean room-Trendy cafe/bar onsite-Valet parking was around $70 and a parking garage down the block was half the price. We liked having this option. Cons:-The elevators! What a wonky/weird system! You have to type in the floor your room is on then it will quickly flash which of the 8 tiny elevators to take. It took us a while to figure this out! Once you're in the elevator there are no buttons or options to choose your floor. Also, they're so small that we had to wait at least 3 trips until one came that we could fit on. -Gloomy/dark-lit hallways-Tiny rooms. Yes they had everything we needed but they were a lot smaller than competing hotels nearby. -Hidden fees/extra charges. We paid for the room on Hotwire but found charges of over $200 (way more than Hotwire charged us) on our credit card. We are playing phone tag now to get our money back. ",7/26/18,3
"Close to times square and Hotel staff were great. Rooms were clean and only wishes that sheets would be changed everyday (Every 2nd or 3rd day), Had to leave a daily tip to change sheets. Please increase lighting in floor lobby and repair or modernize elevators ",7/26/18,4
Great location near Times Square and many restaurants. Concierges were phenomenal at finding places to accommodate a variety of dietary restrictions. Unfortunately we booked a suite for four. There was one bed which we knew but the sofa was worn and did not fold out for sleeping. Requested extra bedding was never delivered by housekeeping. Others had this issue as well,7/26/18,3
Hotel seems to be renovated not too long ago and everything is in decent shape. The room was a bit tight but since I'm the only one staying in the room its more than adequate. There is also a water machine about 30steps from my room where I can fill up my bottle before I go out every morning which saved a lot of plastic bottles. There is no restaurant at the hotel but the food court connected to the lobby was fantastic and have the famous Luke's lobster so you won't have to go out hunting for it. The hotel is conveniently located to subway and a ton of restaurants near by. The room was surprisingly quite for its location as well which was a pleasant surprise. Staff were helpful and quick upon check in as well,7/25/18,4
"We came back to this hotel because they made visiting NYC so easy for us the first time. The location is central, easy to find from the Lincoln Tunnel, and 24 hour valet parking. Decor is hip, free breakfast, packages affordable. Extremely soft bed and hot water. Used the printer for comedy show tickets and tried the SMILE animated gif machine in the lobby. We will be back next time ",7/25/18,5
"The room was small as I would assume all are in NYC. It was really clean and comfortable. It was a very modern theme, black and white which made it feel fresh and airy. It is a great location to everything we wanted to do. The staff was great! ",7/25/18,5
"My daughter and I loved the location, design theme of the hallways and room, clean and comfortable room, and we had a great view too! The staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed eating at the attached foodcourt style restaurant. ",7/25/18,5
Absolutely wonderful Hotel!!!! The staff are warm and helpful and the location couldn't be more perfect for getting around the city!! The complimentary glasses of wine were a terrific surprise!! Will definitely stay here again,7/25/18,5
"Stayed here for the first time recently and was very happy with it. The beds were incredibly comfortable although the lack of shelf space in the bathroom and the dimness of the hallways was a little disconcerting. However, the friendliness of the staff and the incredibly convenient location to the theater district and Times Square more than made up for those minor shortcomings. Will absolutely stay here again ",7/25/18,5
It was a nice cozy room with a great view. I would definitely come back and stay. Me and my fiance had a little issue with the key card but was resolved. Drinks was a little pricey but was Made well. A over al,7/24/18,5
"This was not a good experience for me. The elevators were falling apart aesthetically inside a few of them. There is not a safety card swipe feature in the elevators. The carpet is dirty in the hallways, and the doors are not very tight in their frame. Light and sound easily seep through. Inside the room aesthetic features were falling apart. ",7/24/18,1
"Perfect place to stay if you want to walk and enjoy New York. Our room was perfect, hospitality was great and we were very satisfied with the cleanliness of our room. Front desk was funny and helpful, maid service was outstanding and the breakfast service was quick. ",7/24/18,5
"Nice hotel with great location. Only few minutes away from Times Square and bus station. A lot of good restaurants around. The rooms were very small, they are offering complementary hot and cold water in every floor which is very nice gesture. The staff were very nice. I forgot my back bag when I was checking out and I called them and they store it to me and I took it back on my next visit to the hotel. Overall I enjoyed my stay there ",7/24/18,3
"Great location compensate for a hectic, hussled and crowded hotel, with small rooms, insufficient elevators (althogh there are 8 lifts, 4 up to the 15th floor and 4 from there up), sometimes you have to wait over 10 minutes for alift to go down. No breakfast, bit on the 1st floor there's a food court with all you need, including a cafe with very good coffee (separated from the food court).The roons are small, so if you get a chance to upgrade- go for it. There's no minibar in the room, no coffee or tea corner, no complimentary water bottles, but there is a sfe deposit box. Even in the upgraded room, there wasn't enough space tp open two suitcases. I sent a shirt for laundry on a Thirsday morning, and got it back only on Saturday afternoon. A lot to improve, but as I started with- the location is everything ",7/24/18,3
"Went to this hotel for a NY Couples weekend. Terrific location right neat time square. Was able to walk to shows, shopping restaurants & Bars. A quick walk to subway led us to a terrific Yankees / Mets Subway series gam ",7/24/18,5
"This hotel was referred to us. Website looked promising. Arriving to location and impressions were positive. There will be solicitors bombarding you as you walk up to hotel doors. Check in was not out of the norm for waiting. Lady at concierge was anything but hospitable and I’d go as far as saying she was rude. Elevators were different and we should have been given a heads up how to work them.The hallway to room was very dark and decor/flooring very ugly/dated. The room was ready to our surprise when we checked into hotel around noon. Door to room was what one would find in an old building that retained fixtures without thoroughly stripping them and cleaning them up before repainting them. The size of room was cute, views amazing (23rd floor corner room) the furniture size was appropriate HOWEVER the chairs were dirty.The walls were spotted with some type of beverage by window and the threshold of the sliding door to restroom. There was outlet that didn’t work. The ironing board may have also been in building since early 1900’s. The room walls and ceiling looked like they didn’t strip prior paint, clean surfaces before painting. (Kind of like you’re going out but notice chipped polish on couple of your finger nails and instead of taking time to remove and reapply, you just covered up where the chip parts are and you didn’t use base coat or top coat) (We didn’t unpack the suitcase) The view of the city from the room again were amazing. There was no space on the vanity rack for soap placement so we improvised. There is an area like a food court which looked appealing.. donut spot had beautiful assortment and unique take on donuts I’ve ever had.. like a dense cake. The price of the room we chose had option, for a price, to have free breakfast.. we used it on our last day and we were so disappointed.. soooooo disappointed that we didn’t eat it. We actually had breakfast there two days before (used cash) it was okay... SO I WOULDN’T recommend the upsell on price for the stay. The location of hotel and view is why it’s three stars and not two ",7/24/18,3
I rented the PREMIUM ROOM with a VIEW... expecting to have just that... unfortunately my view was the back of another building. I was put on floor 17 but that did not help. Don't even think about calling to ask for assistance with anything because the hostess is very rude and when asked she will say its all on the back of your door or they should have told you all of that when you checked in. Another downfall is that you have to park in a deck around the corner and walk to the motel as they do not have parking. The room was average. It had a,7/24/18,3
This hotel is just average - for the money you pay you can stay in much nicer places in NYC. There are only 4 lifts to all the floors which take an absolute age when trying to get up or down to/from your room - everyone was complaining about them when we were there. Also in my dad's room there were hairs in the bath when we checked in which is really off-putting. The air-con unit was really noisy / there is a lot of noise from surrounding buildings and all the hotel room doors slam shut. The rooms themselves aren't bad in terms of design/layout and it's in a good location but I wouldn't go back to this hotel for the reasons mentioned above,7/24/18,3
Always a looooooong queue to check in or out!!! How come they dont give back our deposit! Just for the services. Never has a thing like this happened to me. They need to hire more staff to deal with check ins. Staff do all they can but it is impossible for them to handle all guests at the time,7/23/18,1
"Great location, horrible beds, no mini fridge, found a dirty towel and hairs in the tub upon arrival. Did i mention horrible beds? Staff was friendly, lots of hidden room charges and fees. Pillows were rediculously soft that you were forced to try and fold them in the oddest shapes desperately hoping for support. Did i mention the beds??! ",7/23/18,3
"- WiFi was spotty (kept cutting in and out every 15 minutes which wasn't ideal when I was trying to work)- Walls were thin - I could hear everything going on in the hallway, all the doors that were slammed all the voices at all hours of the night- It smelled (public areas reeked of B.O. and/or sewage. Literally every time I stepped into the elevator or the lobby or wherever, it smelled like someone had rubbed their entire sweaty body all over the walls)- Rooms were really small with no space for a desk - again not ideal for working.- The gym was decent but was pretty hot and humid.- They tack on a $30 resort fee on a per day basis which I'm sure is in small print somewhere but would've been nice for someone to overtly point out. Let's try not to trick your guests maybe.- Pretty terrible location if you're there for business. It's a heavy tourist area so you'd need to tack on all the frustrations from that - Checking in took a while (half an hour at 1:30 in the morning with a growing line behind me). I received an email asking me to check in online (which I did) and then was instructed to just ",7/23/18,3
"Upon arriving we were made very welcome, the hotel was full and we had to leave our bags in the closet because the room would be cleared only at 4pm.Had one day in our stay in which the bathroom trash was not collected but the cleaning of the room was made every day.The most critical problem is the elevators that take a long time to get up to the rooms or to get down, and with that there are huge queues waiting for the elevators.As we are frequent guests, we were happy with this new stay at the hotel ",7/23/18,4
"Pros: Location great, staff nice, cleanliness good, restaurant yummy, view from room amazing, discounted parking. Cons: no one answers phone when you call the number online, parking isn't at hotel it's a block away, the elevators are done weird (wait time is awful even though there's 8 of them), it's a historic building that smells historic, bathrooms super small (no joke), no fridge in room. Got a cheaper rate on booking.co ",7/23/18,4
Great hotel only a block or so from Time Square. Only complaint was check in. We prechecked online and were given a registration # and told to go to the kiosk to retrieve our keys. Unfortunately we could not find it nor could the doorman. We ended up waiting in line for more than a half an hour,7/23/18,4
"The location of the Row NYC is just perfect for exploring the vibrant, bright light side of New York. It’s very central in Times Square, so the energy is great. Very close to the most popular Broadway theatres and very close to the subway for travelling all around Manhattan (and other parts of New York if you like). The hotel has a bar/restaurant and also the City Kitchen which is a collection of excellent small vendors selling meals and drinks. The hotel itself is very average, rooms are small and service is adequate (not great). But it’s fine. Enjoy New York from a good spot paying ok rates from an ok hotel. ",7/22/18,3
"Spent 8 nights at The Row and received no personal service or attention. Elevators were horrible, waiting 10 mins every time. Hotel itself was very noisy, we were on the 20th floor and could hear everything happening in the streets and every person walking down the hallways. AC units in the room were loud and we had random flashing lights inside our room that always woke me up in the middle of the night. Never could figure out what they were for. Food options at City Kitchen were adequate but continental breakfast at hotel was not worth the price. Location is good for theater and garmet district but being so close to time square was not for me. Streets outside of the hotel were always crowded. Convenient to 42nd street train access on the E A and C train ",7/22/18,2
"The hotel is well situated in NYC's attraction, but that's it. Stayed there for more than 2 weeks but the room was never fully cleaned even if we requested so several times. The housekeeping staff (Spanish-speaking) does not lift a finger without asking for a ""tex"", which I assume means a tip since she flashed the finger sign of money, that's the time she cleans the room just the parts that can be seen, and replaces the toilet suppies. We even have to help her empty the bins so she will not leave them still with thrash. Also, the hotel is quite old from wear and tear, with the eerie feel of the elevator, and the Front Office staff are nnot that friendly...but I guess it's just the way of New York - and the hotel's not cheap, by the way ",7/22/18,1
"Good experience for my daughter’s first time in NYC. Gave her that hip city vibe and didn’t break mom’s bank. Convenient valet parking at the door was why we chose this hotel. Also, it was close to the Theater and just a skip to Times Square and the subway ",7/22/18,4
It is so convenient to Theater. Very clean. I was only in town a short time so I can’t really let you know how a long stay would be. I wish my room had a tub. I can’t seem to get past the short shower curtain. The water was always all over the floor after my shower,7/22/18,4
"My daughter and I had an awesome mother and daughter shopping trip to New York, the hotel was completely modern and we had Spectacular views in room 2110, everyone of the employees had smiles on their faces and it’s right there in Times Square! We loved it ",7/22/18,5
This is an excellent option for a great experience in NYC. The location is everything. You are in the center of the most interesting city and yet you feel safeguarded and confortable. The attention and service of the employees is A1. This is definitely the place to go in your next visit to New York.,7/22/18,5
"This hotel is close to everything theatre and times square related. Super friendly check in staff. Staff at District M bar was also extremely friendly and accommodating. The elevators are floor staggered and computer controlled which I found to be very efficient. Rooms are nice, clean but not luxurious. Bathroom was a bit small, but totally functional for my needs. Little street noisy at night on the 8th avenue side of the building. Didn't care for the City Kitchen attached to the building. Expensive and not great food IMO. Walk a block down to EuroPan for a better breakfast experience ",7/22/18,4
"Spend your money elsewhere this place is not worth it. lifts, baggage handler, etc were terrible. The premises was old, smelly, unorganised and basically they have a lot of room for improvement. Some staff were nice but thats about it ",7/21/18,1
"The hotel checkin was phenomenal thanks to Yanelly who was beyond helpful and so very professional and sweet. The location is great, walking distance to Times Square. Our room was super clean. My third time here and always a fantastic stay. Thanks Yanelly for your amazing customer service! Montreal is luckily just a short ride away so will be back soon ",7/21/18,5
"Fantastic staff, clean rooms, great location. Friendly bar staff too. Elevators are slow but that's what you get in an old, classic, NYC hotel. Walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, Broadway and great food ",7/21/18,5
"The elevator system and its inability to allow guests to select their floor is unreasonable and stressful. Every trip in or out of the hotel requires factoring in extra time to deal with the inferior elevator system. Room quite tiny with beds low to the floor. Bathroom is the size of an RV bathroom. BUT, breakfast was very good and staff is friendly ",7/21/18,2
We absolutely loved Mauricio! Our room was immaculate and the staff’s customer service was impeccable! Everyone was amazing and very friendly. We could not have asked for a better experience! Thank you Mauricio and The Row NYC Family,7/21/18,5
"My daughter and I spent 6 nights at this hotel. Our first night we checked in at approximately 9pm and was provided a sub-standard room: dirty carpet, rusty shower head, dirty shower and window curtain, along with a huge dip in the middle of the tub covered by a liner. Due to our hectic schedule we filed a complaint the next night with the Manager on duty, Stephen. We were told they did not have another room to transition to so we came back the following night to switch rooms. What a horrible surprise!! The manager did not have the courtesy to acknowledge us nor apologize for our long wait while he tended to new guests who came in AFTER US!! Now the new room we received at 11:30pm was not cleaned and the housekeeper had not been in! We went back down to complain once again and the manager was too racist to acknowledge us. THANK GOD FOR SHANTELE!! She came to our rescue, gave us a CLEANNN room and had the bell attendant transfer our luggage to the new floor. She was very nice and accomodating. Quite frankly she should be the Manager of that hotel. Very professional woman. The third room turned out to me great and we were finally able to enjoy our stay. Unfortunately, because of the manager Stephen, we will never stay at ROW NYC in the future ",7/21/18,2
"Small but nice room, great location, located on 8th and 44th st., walking distance from Times Square. Check out at noon. Surrounded by multiple restaurants and coffee shops including McDonald and Starbucks. Friendly staff, I was given 1 hr checkout extension, free ice. 5 minutes walking from the last bus stop (Bryant Park Times Square) if coming from JFK,. There was $34 hotel fee collected at the hotel, most hotels in NYC has this type fee. Flat fee taxi back to airport if requested by Hotel staff (Approximately $60) at this time ",7/21/18,4
"Stayed at this hotel for three nights while visiting New York for the first time. Had a bit of a hard time finding the hotel while walking on the street because the sign is not well placed. But, the hotel location turned out to be great being close to Times Square and the Subway. Also, there are a huge number of restaurants close by giving a vast choice for food. The room was relatively small, but my wife commented that every needed amenity was neatly placed in the room. The hallway lighting could be improved, but the wallpapering deco is quite dramatic. The price was very reasonable for New York and for the location. If you are not planning on spending a lot of time staying in the room, this hotel is a great choice ",7/21/18,5
If you’re looking a hotel less than 5 mins from Times Square this hotel is perfect for you. Rooms are much smaller than photos suggest but have all the necessities and you’ll probably not spend much time in them. Gym is basic but again welcome addition if you struggle with jet lag or struggle dealing with the time difference. Bar area is very modern and relaxed and a great addition to the hotel after a Day sightseeing or shopping,7/21/18,4
I would look around for other hotels. Size of room was a huge issue for me as well as dark and scary hallways. Junior listened to my concerns and did what he could to make my stay with less anxiety. !,7/20/18,3
"Want to be close to all the big theatres and tourist spots, but don't feel like paying the crazy luxury accommodation rates? This is your spot. Nothing extra fancy, just clean rooms, friendly staff, and a great location. Try the food at City Kitchen, you even get a discount at some of the vendors when you show your room key ",7/20/18,5
"This hotel is ideal as for transit accommodation, but we were booked into it as part of a package including journeys there and back to the UK on the QM2, plus fireworks on the river for Independence Day, so we were there for 5 nights, which proved too long at this hotel. When we arrived and checked in at 9:10 a.m. we were told that we could not access our room until 4:00 p.m. This when we were still dressed as for the QM2, carrying all our vital documents, and when the temperature outside was nearly 100 degrees, and the humidity unbearable. There were no public areas, except a noisy bar, and we had to go elsewhere for breakfast. The room was adequate, but we were charged $172 extra for WiFi and for use of a machine in the corridor supplying ice and water, which then did not work for 2 days.On the postive side the staff were pleasant and the location excellent, being only a few minutes walk from Times Square ",7/20/18,3
"Very disappointed with the Row NYC. Beds were not comfortable - saggy mattresses. We needed to wait at least 10 minutes ANYTIME we needed to use the elevators because a couple of them weren’t working. Elevators were very small and could only accommodate around 10 people. Since elevators weren’t working, often it was a longer wait because of the amount of people that had gathered to use them.We could have used a refrigerator in the room. We must have misunderstood that there was one upon booking. Hotel staff was excellent however ",7/20/18,2
"Took the LAX red -eye and upon landing headed to Row with the hopes that I could at least find a place to sit, eat, get some wifi and wait for my meeting before checking-in at the standard 3pm. Good news was able to get early check-in and at a fraction of the price of my room! Grabbed 4 hours of amazing snooze time and crushed it at my meeting. Bonus, you are right in the middle of everything NYC! I found the best rate and received first class service. There is a solid mix of people staying at the hotel and it's quite busy, but sukit your in NYC ",7/19/18,5
"Great location in Manhatttan. Reasonable rates. Very clean, prompt, friendly service. When I requested an extra pillow, it arrived within minutes. Comfortable bed. Tiny room however, badly located TV. Depressing hallways ",7/19/18,4
"This hotel has definitely gone downhill since our last visit a year ago (we have stayed there many times in the past. Lack of elevators to higher floors caused a 10+ minute wait (often). An elevator got stuck for an hour while were were there and the fire department came. The elevators are crammed so full that you almost can't breath because people are so desperate to get in because of the lack of access...There were people smoking in this non smoking hotel next door to us - which we reported 3 times - and nothing was ever done (5 day stay). The housekeeping staff was friendly and easy to work with and we had to work with them often because the shower curtain was a foot too short for the shower so water sprayed all over the floor of the bathroom when using....also, there is a towel bar sticking out in the shower at head level that prevents you from standing anywhere but directly under the shower head or you will hit your head on it. Upon arrival the man at the Conciege desk told us he can't help us because he didn't work for the hotel (???? Why is he standing in the middle of the lobby at the check in area? 0 After staying at the Row many times n the past this will be the last time I'm sorry to say... ",7/19/18,1
The hotel was convenient and staff was helpful and friendly however the elevators weren't working properly and was extremely time consuming. Because of this it caused several inconveniences for me as a guest.,7/19/18,3
"I stayed in this hotel years ago when it was Milford Plaza, and it's definitely been updated. My room was spacious, though sparse with the amenities. The location is good for Times Square/Broadway, etc. though it's a very busy area. The check-in process took quite a while because the line was long and few staff doing check-ins. There is a self check-in station though I could not get it to work. The prices are reasonable for the area so I can see why it's popular for tourists, though I was on a business trip. Not my favorite hotel but I would stay again ",7/19/18,3
"Best thing about this hotel is it’s location. Close to Times Square, Metro, Bus terminal. Rooms are small but I could understand given the value of space in heart of NYC. Price is acceptable as well. What stood out for me was people at front desk. They are like Police Sergeants interrogating you. First thought that I might have come across an odd one, but on couple of subsequent visits at front desk, I noticed all were the same and to everyone. The best of all was perhaps the duty manager. Had a package delivered from store, it took 24 hours to be shipped from store to hotel and another 24 hours to be sent from package room to my room. Repeated calls and no one will pick from Package room, left messages: no use. Talked to front desk & concierge, they would just forward call to Package room, where again no one will pick up. Finally when someone did pick up, she tells me, I will get it at end of the day, when I ask her it has been in hotel since yesterday, she Ella me, well She has just come for her shift. Anyhow she did deliver soon after. ",7/19/18,2
I normally love this hotel. I have stayed here many many times over the years (several times a year). The bed mattresses and pillows are very very comfy (although only a double size bed). The location is exceptional. The,7/18/18,3
"Nice room. Friendly staff. Centrally located. Not ideal for family of four due to really small room with a really tiny bathroom, but that’s why you get in Times Square. No refrigerator. Overall a great value for downtown Manhattan. Clean room. Great lobby area with bar and attached food court. Perfect for couples or singles who only need to use the room to sleep and want to stay in Times Square area ",7/18/18,4
"Everything looks sort of nice at first, low lighting, cool looking lobby etc. We were the only people in line to check in, 2 people behind the reception desk and no one said a thing until I spoke up. We were told we would have a room with a queen size bed but we were given a room with a full bed. Room was so small there was no place to put our luggage. We called the front desk to ask for a bigger room with a queen size bed and they suggested a room that we could see from the floor map was even smaller! Ice machine broken on our floor and the one above and one above that. Room was only cleaned for one day of our 3 day stay. Closet had 5 hangers for 2 people. Elevator situation is a nightmare. Garbage in the hallways. We will never stay here again ",7/18/18,2
"Convenient location for everything - theatre, restaurants, Central Park & transport. This is an old hotel and this must be kept in mind. Dollars don’t go a long way in NYC so it’s hard to review anything further ",7/18/18,3
"So just checked in, apparently, there was a mix up with our booking my older mother thought when she booked a double room it came with two beds. She tried to explain that she saw two beds online and thought double meant two her bad. We went and saw what was an upgraded room with one bed and realized that there was no way me her and my pre-teen son could manage so we asked for a double room I mean a room with 2 beds. Originally we were offered said upgrade for an additional $30 bucks a night now the guy says its $40 when he is called out he says he will honor the discount. Lets just say his attitude leaves a lot to be desired, wait I thought the number one rule in customer service is the customer is always right so sir don't get aggressive over the phone my mother is not a native. Anywho we are now in the new room paying over $300 a night there are stains on the wall, various looking splatters, the comforter has stains, the wood on the furniture is chipped and even the wall has dents WOW. I am taking pictures now and attaching them as proof because if they even try and pin this on us. Honestly, I've stayed at various hotels in New York hands down the trend seems to be the legacy hotels are just better. If you care I'm vlogging and sharing my trip on social at supplechicI'll update if need be but first impressions, first impressions the ROW NYCI'd give it a 2.5 stars but trip advisor doesn't let you if you get this hotel for $120 a night or less (its new york) go ahead anymore is a hell no ",7/18/18,2
"I stayed in room #915. There was a pervasive and unrelenting smell of mold, or something, coming from what I believe was the bathroom or bedroom carpet. I assume the cause was patched over by new materials. I did not report this during my stay as I did not want to deal with the hassle (I knew I would only be sleeping in this room), however when I entered initially, the bathroom window was open, so the smell was seemingly known about.I found this room through a discount site, but didn't assume that meant a sub par room. The location was prime and the lobby breakfast / bar were a lifesaver, but the smell of the room was pretty terrible. I certainly could and should have switched rooms, but I have never come across such a fowl smelling hotel room ",7/18/18,2
Nice hotel comfortable rooms and bed but way to long of a wait for elevators they should have more than 2 going to the higher floors. It always took 5-10 minute wait for one. Front desk and bell men were great!,7/18/18,4
"Check-in was amazing with a very friendly and welcoming staff member, but things went downhill from there. The room was tiny, but functional (other than the TV which was on a wall you couldn't watch from the bed - which was the only place to sit in the room, because it was so small) and the bathroom was clean, but with terrible water pressure. I then got stuck in an elevator with 7 other people on my first night there for nearly 2 hours, and for the rest of my stay only 2 elevators were working to get to my floor (which resulted in very long waiting times). I received a breakfast voucher as an apology, but when I went to redeem it at a quarter to 12 at the bar, was told that breakfast ended at 11:30 by a very rude staff member, who then ignored me when I told him that the guest information packet in my room said it was until noon on weekends. This place has an undeniably great location, and some staff members make you feel great just for walking through the door; on the other hand there are some who probably should rethink their choice to work with the public, and the amenities need to be a lot more consistent for the prices that are being charged. ",7/18/18,2
"this was an awesome hotel for the money. great location and reasonably priced. i stayed with my 21 old daughter for the night and everything was in walking distance. we had a great time. we got the parking package, the valet parked the car for us and we were able to store our bags there before and after checkout. we both would definitely stay there again. ",7/17/18,4
The staff was not very pleasant on multiple encounters throughout the stay. The room was very small (as expected in NYC) but the bathroom door wouldnt open all of the way because it was blocked by the bed. Location and cleanliness were decent,7/17/18,2
"The location is great, staffs are friendly. But the bathroom is not good. There are some stains on shower head and the toilet. Also the fan is not working in the bathroom. Some plugs in the room are not working too ",7/17/18,3
Room furniture and amenities were in poor condition. towels and sheets did not feel clean and comforter was not covered. Disappointed in quality of room based on the images we saw on the website- not representative of true quality,7/17/18,2
"Would recommend this hotel to someone wanting a short term stay close to the theatre district and times square. Walls are thin, could hear neighbours conversations and television clearly, lots of street noise as well ",7/17/18,3
"Huge Hotel, great location, close to Times Square. Metro nearby. Excellent for all those who attach great importance to the location. The check in people were quite professionals and everything went well for all of us (2 adults + 2 children). I'll be back for sure on a next visit to New York ",7/17/18,4
Elevator security is over the top and not necessary. Horrible smell coming from bathroom pipes - hotel did nothing to correct it. Hotel is cheap so you can’t expect much. Bar and food options are good.,7/17/18,3
Honestly was great and clean the staff at the front desk was super nice and polite I think his name was Ceaser. I loved this place it felt like home and if I had any problems I’m sure they would have helped but the whole night was great,7/16/18,5
Trip to Broadway and Shania with my family in Summer 2018. Chose this hotel for location but was disappointed with elevator and bathroom issues as well as check in. Maybe an upgraded room would have been more acceptable,7/16/18,3
"We stayed there for 3 days, went to Philadelphia and then returned for 3 more days. Good points: Location - walking distance to theaters , shops and restaurants. CleanBad points: Very small rooms - only ONE bedside table in a double room. Very small place to put your things away in the room. The hotel does not store your luggage overnight - even returning to the same hotel we had to take all the luggage to Philadelphia. They only store luggage if you arrive before check in time or need to wait for transportation after check out. Staff - not very friendly - we just found one receptionist who was. The male concierge was even worse - barely looked at you and answered everything mechanically and impatiently. Loud music playing constantly in the elevators - if an elevator breaks down the people inside will probably go crazy before they're rescued ",7/16/18,3
The Row NYC is close to Times Square and therefore easy to get around. We stayed twice in a month. Issues with lifts was consistently an issue and with having 2 of the 4 out of action for floors 18 - 28 it meant 15-20 mins wait. We found the concierge on both visits to be unhelpful,7/16/18,3
"I have never been so disappointed in a hotel stay. From the outside Row NYC looks like a nice hotel but that is definitely not the case.The room I was given after upgrading on hotwire was less than desirable and was not very clean. During my 2 nights at the hotel I did not walk on the carpet with bare feet or shower without sandals. I don't know when these rooms were last updated but the photographer they used should definitely win an award. I wasn't expecting luxury by any means but I expect cleanliness. The condition of the room made me feel like I was sleeping in a motel next to a truck stop. After going to the front desk and asking for a different room I was told that even though I upgraded on hotwire, they usually assign the best rooms to guest that book directly through the hotel vs a travel website like hotwire, expedia, etc because they pay more. In all my years of traveling this was a first hearing this. The elevators were another story. I don't know who came up with the system they use but it is not very efficient and leaves people very frustrated. If you are in the lobby during a peak time it's like the hunger games to get onto an elevator and twice I requested an elevator from my floor and and the display read, ""no lift available"". I seriously challenge management or whoever is reading and responding to these reviews to really inspect the rooms for their cleanliness and see what it's like waiting for an elevator in the lobby and requesting one from their floor. On a positive note, I will say most of the staff I encountered was friendly but that does not make up for the other issues I had with this hotel. ",7/16/18,1
The Hotel was awesome and Ceaser at the front desk was especially helfull and very kind and welcoming. Because of Him i felt very welcoming from the StartI would definitely recommend this Hotel to my friends and Family,7/16/18,5
"This Hotel was very average and what I expected of NYC, however the people where very helpful and you felt safe as there were security personnel everywhere, there is also a small food hall attached to this Hotel which was reasonable for what the rest of New York's price was like in that area. It also included a good gym. However the rooms were very small and not much space for two people to cohabit in. But the rooms were very clean; I just assumed it was easy to clean because the room was so small. The best thing about the hotel was the location as we were a 5 min walk from times square and also in walking distance of everything in midtown and also all the tour bus locations were situated in that area ",7/16/18,3

"You could ignore urine smell around the ground lobby and reception - not all the day you spend there, after all. You may also ignore an exotics of backdoor elevator ride while all main are dow. But you can't ignore when being ignored by staff. Cause you are at temporary home. At full cost. And some staff should realise you owe them nothing as a customer. By now, it all looks more like Railway station rather than hotel in that mix ",7/15/18,3
"from Glasgow, scotland, UKthe first time i arrived it was with friends then came back 2nd, 3rd and fourth time with my mum, perfect location honestly cant say a bad word about it. Around $70 (incl tip) from jfk airport to hotel, although this time we took a transfer bus which we booked via Expedia for around £20 each. Hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. rooms are small but adequate,and got an amazing view, to be honest we were barely in our room as we were out exploring the wonderful city from early morning till late at night. we had breakfast in the hotel and it was nice but preferred to eat out as it was cheaper (mainly at a deli or the food court for breakfast lunch or dinner which is opposite the hotel) if you do go in there for lunch or dinner you need to try Nathans for its loaded fries its amazing im obsessed. Plenty of eating and drinking places within distance you will be spoilt for choice.we originally bought our explorer pass via barrhead travel in the UK, however they were useless im glad we did our homework, we got a 5 day pass and picked this up at west 42nd street near ripleys believe it or not. used the subway quite allot this time, was tired at the end of the day so be prepared for lots of stairs. costs you like $1 to buy then you load this up for the fare you need for journey either 1 day,2 days etc very cheap.i booked via attraction world (what barrhead travel use to book excursions)- tour of washington dc when i was in nyc, i had originally did this tour on previous visits so i knew what to expect cost £135 each but well worth it, its a full day so again be prepared for walking.a must see:the high line- its a public park built on a historic rail line it runs from the meatpacking district to west 34th street, between 10th and 12th av. chelsea marketBrooklyn bridge9/11 memorialcentral parkgrand central terminalstatue of liberty (tip get the Staten island ferry its free, doesn't take you there but you still get good photos if your running out of time)Washington square parkRadio city music tour is a must!!!! i loved this, we booked the Christmas spectacular show via attraction world and we got amazing seats!!!! tip- keep spare dollars aside incase you need to tip for tours etc for food/drinks we used our sainsburys currency travel card which swipes and we signed for ",7/15/18,5

I have recently needed to get in touch with The Row NYC prior to my visit early next year. I received a reply very quickly and they have sorted out my problem. I am very impressed with the communication from this hotel. Really looking forward to our visi,7/15/18,4
"We booked online and the full price was given then, but they put a $50 hold on our card and took out $34 without telling us what this was for until afterwards. This may be standard practice but we don't usually stay at hotels and it was inconvenient. That being said, the view was nice. We did have to go to another floor to get water, but it wasn't a huge hassle. Mostly the hotel staff wasn't very helpful and I'm saying this as a service worker who knows what kind of pressure people in service jobs are under. I don't want to sound like a b**** and in the end of the day we were in a nice location for a very fair price but there were a few things you might not expect ",7/15/18,4
"I am currently halfway through my stay at The Row and wanted to give a review while everything is fresh in my mind. Rooms are quite small but beds are comfortable enough. Housekeeping needs to do a better job, hair on walls of shower that is for sure not mine or my daughters. First night was given a nice corner king room however the walls here are very thin and we kept hearing a baby crying every hour all night. Had to move rooms and we were going to be moved to a smaller room than what I paid for. We had to repack and drag our luggage downstairs. Told that no room was ready so had to get out of our current room with no new room which seemed unfair since I had paid for this room already. Hours later, when we could get a room they were going to give us a queen when I had paid for a King room. Now, for the bright spot in this ....JUNIOR. This man at the desk truly cares. He worked to make thinks right and went above and beyond to make sure things were made right and we were satisfied. I do not even want to waste my time with anyone else at the desk because they just don’t care that much! I would have been so upset if not for Junior working with us to salvage our stay. If you stay here, insist on checking in with Junior because he will answers your questions and help out however he can. Pros: location, value, free WiFi, JUNIORCons: thin walls, long elevator wait, could be cleane ",7/15/18,4
"This hotel was formerly known as the Milford Plaza, and was long a favorite of international tourists seeking a Times Square-area hotel at a reasonable price. The Row has been updated in a funky sort of New York way, which you may or may not like. The rooms tend to be quite small, and many have full beds, rather than queen or king-size. That said, the room was clean and adequately equipped, and was fine for our one night stay. Bottom line, it was good value for the money ",7/15/18,3
"Great location, rooms are small and a bit old. Decent if all you need is a place to sleep. Don’t expect great service, the check in process is slow. Decent gym. Overall good value for NYC.....best part and most important is location, walking distance to timesquare, Broadway, Central Park, Empire State, Rockefeller center and shopping. ",7/14/18,4
If you are looking for a basic room in the heart of NYC and are on a budget - I recommend this hotel. The rooms are small but clean. The staff was friendly. This hotel is in the center of Times square - close to subways etc....It is surrounded by much nicer hotels that are more than twice the cost. If you want luxury - then try another hotel. If you want a clean & comfortable place to sleep - this is your place,7/14/18,3
"We stayed 2 nights at the hotel, towels and shampoo were not changed during the stay.The hotel WIFI is of a reasonable standard, sometimes stuck.We wanted to get a late checkout but the maximum possible is one hour beyond the normal checkout time ",7/14/18,3
"Very good customer service - they helped me work out some kinks in my travel plans. The front desk workers were very friendly as well as the rest of the staff. Housekeeping did knock on my door at 6AM though and I said I didn't need them and they knocked again at 9AM but other than that, things were fine. ",7/14/18,5
"the hotel was very disappointing. whilst located conveniently to Times Square and the play houses etc, the hotel itself was noisy (loud music going at all time in the foyer), the rooms were too small (2 of us in the one room could not have 2 suitcases open at the one time and there was minimal room to move between the bed and walls), the hallways smelt and the bathroom had mould on the walls. The check in wasn't until 4pm - there were many people sitting around waiting to get in - and the check out was at 9am - hardly time at all.... the breakfasts were appalling - OK if you like budget fare including anything fried and unhealthy - but not to my taste - and no opportunity to have anything else unless you wanted donuts. The air conditioner in the room was loud - needed to use ear plugs. I did request a room change (at our own expense) but the other room offered was just as bad with aircon noise - This is a hotel for young people who have little experience in travelling and are prepared to put up with this sort of bad cheap experience.... but for an older experienced traveller (50's) such as myself - don't bother... go somewhere else.... ",7/13/18,1
"The hotel is in a prime location of New York City which is a block away from Times Square off of 8th avenue and 44th street. The staff was extremely nice and helpful upon arrival. Our room was clean upon entry and well kept throughout our stay. The bed was comfortable and the shower worked well. There was a TV with tons of channels and great lighting in the room. Plenty of room for our luggage and a view of Times Square to die for. The housekeepers cleaned the room everyday and made sure we had the right supplies. They were also very sweet ladies that were talkative and helpful. There was a very cool setting in the lobby with a hotel lounge/bar to relax. Right next to it was a walkway that took you to City Kitchen where there were about 6-7 places to eat with great food. Outside you can walk through theatre district to get to Times Square. You can literally find anything to eat, places for shopping, bars, lounges, and anything else you can think of within walking distance of the hotel. There are amazing restaurants off of 8th avenue and 46th street that we highly enjoyed. The subway stops were close by which was helpful to get around when wanting to explore other parts of New York. We stayed at the hotel for 12 days and were glad to call it our home for vacation. We highly recommend it and will stay again on our next trip. Thank you Tyler for an amazing experience. ",7/13/18,5
"If you’re not staying in your room much, then this place will be ok. Great location. Can’t really give this place a great review as the male gentlemen that checked us in was the rudest person to service us anywhere(not just hotels). ",7/13/18,2
"Stayed at Row for my daughter's 14th birthday which included a Broadway Show. Incredible location, fantastic parking, exceptional staff! Couldn't have been a better stay. Will Definitely stay here again next time we visit New York ",7/13/18,5
"Avoid this hotel becouse of the price, the noise inside the rooms, they are not very clean and they need being refurbised. Lobby very moder, music, cocktails but the attention of the desk is very bad and despective ",7/13/18,1
"Booked the Row NYC on the recommendation of my daughter who had stayed there previously on an educational trip with school. The hotel with its modern interior is clean and comfortable, we found ourselves sinking into the pillows at the end of each day and enjoyed a great nights sleep. Time Square is just around the corner and many of the other major attractions are within comfortable walking distance. Had always thought that New York was somewhere that I would want to visit just the once, visit once and the city gets under your skin and in your heart, will definitely return to New York and I will definitely be staying at the Row NYC when I do! ",7/12/18,5
"Only 3 pillows on a full size mattress with no box spring. Bedding was dirty. Also was instructed to check in online and to proceed to kiosk to collect my key. Only problem was the kiosks didn’t exist, you get to wait in line of 30 people after all ",7/12/18,2
Priced well for location and valet package was an excellent deal! Perfect for a short stay in NYC. Elevators & rooms could use an update but overall it was a good hotel with a very central location. The staff was friendly and accommodating and we have no complaints about service at The Row NYC,7/12/18,3
I would recommend the hotel because the location is more than good everything is a walking distance but they can improve something to make the experience better ! Like the fact that they don’t take cash in the sugar store ( ice cream store ),7/12/18,3
"When heater was put on room was very stuffy, I got sick, nasally and feverish. Ok stay for budget travel, there is cafe and a convenient store at the bottom which is where I got some paracetamol from which was convenient ",7/12/18,2
"Right in the middle of everything, theatres, food options... but what i appreciated most was the efficiency of booking, checkin and checkout! Rooms are a bit small but bed very comfortable! Thank you Row NYC ",7/12/18,4
"The hotel overall is cool and well located. Room is small, but good distribution. We had 2 windows (that was a plus). The bathroom is kind of small and kind of uncomfortable. No room to change your clothes in there ",7/11/18,4
This hotel is centrally located for most of the attractions and I would say all within walking distance. I found all the staff very helpful although be wary there is an extra charge to pay for facilities - £180 approx. for 6 days. Im not really sure what its for other than adding to your room cost however I was aware it was payable before I travelled. We had an upgraded room with a city view which wasn't that large but had everything we needed and a great view of the river. The room was very tired inside and at best has a smililar standard to a very basic Travelodge but was cleanand the bed comfortable. If you are looking for luxury this isn't for you but if you are happy with a basic room in a great location then stay at the Row NY,7/11/18,4
"This place is two blocks away from Times Square and is in the middle of other more expensive hotel chains (Westin, Intercontinental, Hyatt), we paid a really good rate for the time we spent there and were very happy with our decision. The service was great (with the exception of a lady with a tattoo on her right biceps at the check out desk who was the embodiment of NY rudeness), the room was properly sized but the bathroom was huge and felt really high-end, the comfort of the beds was terrific and the views to the city are very interesting; overall the hotel is a very good and comfortable option ",7/11/18,4
"As far as staying at the Row for my first time in New York, I am glad I did. Great experience, even if check-in was a little slow. Elevator time was a little bit sketchy too. Seems that it could be upgraded in some way ",7/11/18,5
"Okay, so I can tell you we have stayed here twice now. This hotel is the perfect location if you are going for the Broadway experience. Sure it has fees but every booking site I have seen warns about the fees. The hotel next to all the theaters and has City Kitchen right next to it. City Kitchen is a very cheap restaurant with lots of options. The hotel cleanliness is on par for a hotel in the price range. The room and bathrooms are very clean. The hallways are just good enough. I would stay at this hotel over and over. I recently saved 20.00 a night going to a nearby hotel just to save a few dollars and regretted it! We will be going back to ROW very soon. I stayed back in Sept of last year and May of this year. Same great experience ",7/11/18,5
The location of this hotel is good with theater nearby. Close to amenities and eateries. The room is clean and bright with white finishes. The staff at reception was friendly and offers suggestions to our queries. Great Stay,7/10/18,5
"Aside from the filth, peeling wallpaper, and damaged furniture, the guestrooms did not feel welcoming at all. Essentially, it felt like a hostile with decent wallpaper. Management tried showing me a different room, but it was still the same poor quality as the first. I will not come back. ",7/10/18,1
"Very central location , nice staff , clean small rooms restaurants everywhere and can walk 5 minutes to Penn station. You can get an express bus to Newark airport walking distance to theaters and times square ",7/10/18,4
"Everything was great except for a sliding barn style door on the bathroom, with big enough gaps that there was no sound privacy at all. Other than that, great staff, safety, cleanliness, modern bath and room, comfortable. It's basic, no frills, but all we needed ",7/10/18,5
"Loved the hotel. Amazing location , weekend market right outside the hotel. Very central area close to shopping and good restaurants. Bigger rooms than most hotels in New York. Was not very happy with housekeeping. ",7/10/18,4
"Good location but nothing extra, room was not super clean, by the way we had a good view.we could watched the World Cup at the bar. We expected more for the price and for a 3 or 4 star hotel.we had a good time by the way.. ",7/10/18,3
"Perfectly located, closed to Time Square in a very very central position. Room was acceptable but needed some care to meet 4stars assignment. Noise isolation from outside is a bit annoying, therefore ask for silent room. Bathroom was small but clean. The staff is nice and always gentle and available ",7/10/18,3
"The hotel is well located in the 8th avenue, but I was really disappointed by this hotel. The air conditioner in the room was too loud, furnitures in the room looked old, and some of the were broken, pretty shocking for a 4* hotel. The bathroom smelled bad, and the staff was not very smiley. I had the impression that they were not really happy doing their job. It’s very expensive for what it is. And don’t advice you this place ",7/10/18,2
"Great location. Clean and organized. Attentive attendants. Satisfactory bedroom and bathroom. Very good coffee space, and space to watch very nice screen. we had a great stay with nothing to complain about ",7/10/18,5
"Small, but immaculate room. Nice breakfast space (with delicious bagels!) Common areas needed cleaning. Relaxed vibe with many international visitors. Near theaters and restaurants... Birdland was right around the corner~ It was a pleasure to be back at Row NYC ",7/10/18,4
"The staff was friendly and courteous. The room and facility was clean and well maintained, and we were a quick walk (1 block) to Times Square and the Port Authority bus station/metro. The room was a little on the small side, but then again, it was the first time I’ve been to NY, so I’m guessing that’s pretty typical of the area. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely stay there again for the price ",7/10/18,4
"I stay here twice a year for the past 4 years... looking forward to coming back again in December. Location is great, rooms are fantastic, staff very friendly. Rates are so good... really fantastic overal ",7/10/18,5
This hotel is great and convenient. The staff is very friendly and helpful should issues arise. The rooms are basic but clean. We enjoy staying here. The food court and the bar are also quite nice. The hotel attracts a younger crowd and the lobby can get quite hectic at times but if that doesn’t bother you then this could be the place for you,7/9/18,5
"Hotel is in a good location in Times Square. However the check in guy initially did put you off by stating the resort fees in addition to room cost when in fact we had already paid for the resort fees which were inclusive in our quote. Overall, good experience though apart from the check in service. ",7/9/18,4
"The hotel is located within the center of Times Square and the Theater district. You can walk almost anywhere in the city that relates to entertainment! The hotel is modern, with a lot of amenities, but the rooms are small and the hallways to the rooms seem almost claustrophobic ",7/9/18,4
"My husband and I stayed there as a last minute getaway. He’s never been to New York and it was the perfect location. I wanted to see Bryant Park around Christmas time and explore the city with him because I hadn’t been for a long time. It was in a great location. The bartender at the bar in the hotel was awesome, unfortunately I forget his name. They had music playing one night which was great. The rooms were small but we didn’t spend much time in our room anyway, most rooms are small in NYC. It was a very clean hotel, the decor was really cool and District M was awesome. It was nice to have a bunch of food options right at the hotel and a coffee after a late night of bar hoping and exploring. ",7/9/18,4
Employees were rude to all I saw them engage with. They seemed like they hated their job and didn’t care about how their attitude cane across to guests. I do this for a living. I’m a customer experience manger.,7/9/18,4
"Really good location as it is on 8th Avenue and within the Theatre District and Times Square, so really easy to walk to many attractions. The hotel itself is aged and needs a good clean up and modernization. It is really busy with the lobby area feeling like a train station! The check-in was very impersonal and had long queues especially at 4pm. Our room had two double beds with little else. We were a family of two adults and two teenagers. There was barely room to walk around the beds so was very tight with our suitcases etc. The bathroom was small but there were plenty of towels which were changed daily. The beds were very clean and comfortable also. Because it was hot we needed air conditioning but the unit was inside the room and was extremely noisy - it did work very well though and it helped that we were all tired so were able to sleep! There was a view of 8th Ave but through a filthy window which was a pity. We got 4 coffees and 4 croissants on the first morning which cost €35 so be aware of the prices before parting with your money! Overall I would recommend it if you wanted a clean bed in a central area of NY at a reasonable price and you weren’t going to spend time in the room or hote ",7/9/18,3
"Situated in a great location, this hotel provides all the basic amenities plus a few nice little extras. Other than this the check in/check out process needs a lot of improvement (the lines are way too long) and the food leaves a whole lot to be desired. If your focus is on being at the heart of times square with easy access to everything then you have the perfect budget hotel. other than that i would look for something more suitable for unwinding or family relaxation tim ",7/9/18,2
"Check in was pleasant. Free, organised storage facility for early check in and after check out, was convenient. Location was good, close to Times Square. Room basic and comfortable. Faulty mobile phone usb ports, were replaced immediately after reporting.In the NYC heat, filtered water was appreciated. Overall experience, was pleasant and would stay again ",7/9/18,4
Perfect location for our 11 days in NYC :) Its close to almost everything. Showercurtain didn’t stop the water from flooding the bathroom floor... a bit stoopid construction:) Aircondition in the room was nice:,7/9/18,3
"A client recommended this hotel for its convenient location near Times Square and Penn Station. The rooms were small but comfortable. The bed was comfortable. Air conditioning a little noisy but I kept a window open in the bathroom to cut down on its usage. Front desk and staff accommodating and pleasant. The hotel offers great selections for eat in and take out food--from tacos to lobster rolls, coffee and fresh pastries to pancakes and scrambled eggs and bacon from different vendors who have stalls in a separate and convenient location close to the main lobby. Open and available from morning to late evening. The food was great and reasonably priced. Beer, wine available, along with tables to sit and eat/meet others, or take food/drink to your room. The bar had a good vibe with food also available there. Reasonable rates. Recommend you give it a try ",7/9/18,4
The old Milford Plaza has been renovated nicely-except for the very funky radiator in the bathroom! The room was small but very clean. We were on the 27 floor so the street noise wasn’t bad. We did not upgrade so there was no view but the blackout shades worked well. We used the pre-checkin and our room was ready when we arrived at 2:30pm. Express checkout was also very convenient,7/9/18,4
"We decided to stay overnight before our Hello Dolly show. Have stayed at the Row before and was pleased once more. Even tho room card machine was broken, everything else was perfect. Will stay again! ",7/9/18,5
"our experience in ROW NYC was very good. It is situated near Times Square, the room is large and clean, you get clean towels every day, there is high speed WIFI and water filtration stations available to fill your bottle ",7/8/18,4
Can’t say that I will be back at this hotel - as when I checked in it was liked they were doing me a favor !! Rooms tiny - but with all amenities and a good bed and pillows- which is important to me and in a very good location. Next time I will stay at Luma or intercontinental - a safer be,7/8/18,2
"First time visiting New York city and it did not disappoint. We arrived on a wet and wild night and was relieved to find Row NYC quite easily form the 43rd St Subway. I must stress, if you haven't been to NYC, be prepared for small hotel rooms!!! This was quite a shock to us however the room provided all we needed. A comfy bed, a fully equipped bathroom, views of the Hudson and Hell's Kitchen and easy access to the heart of NYC! we stayed 7-8 nights and spent most of our time out and about, not nearly enough time to see 1% of NYC but it was a start. My only complaint about the the Hotel and room that I feel could be better is the $25USD 'service charge' for room Wifi/internet. spending $200USD on internet for anyone is absolutely ridiculous. (travelled from Australia) Next time I visit I will be sure to inspect the charges as would not have taken this option and just bought a local SIM card with data for my iPhone ",7/8/18,4
"The good: very close to Times Square, a modern aspect to the hotel, and super fast internet connection.The bad: very expensive for what it offers, an expensive service charge which you cannot avoid paying, and don't include the breakfast in the price like I did - it is just a croissant, coffee and piece of fruit! The ugly: seeing as it is a old building which was renovated, some parts are already showing the age ",7/8/18,4
"Right in the middle of Times Square so obviously location is top. The room is way too small... open the suitcases and that’s it, to can move around. Breakfast is under average. Only offer the pastry and some fruits. ",7/8/18,3
"A short walk to Times Square, Rockefeller center, the Intrepid air and space museum. The theater district is just around the corner. Restaurants and pubs near by, and don't missed out on the breakfast at the M in the ROW ",7/8/18,4
"It was my 3rd time at the Row NYC. The 1st time I came here was in 2008 when it was known as Milford! In my heart, it’s a 5 stars hotel for many reasons.1. Proximity to EVERYTHING in New York City. Literally in the center of every popular places in Manhattan. You get out and you're a few blocks from Times Square, Central Park, popular stores, Port Authority, etc. This hotel has a perfect location for a tourist.2. The price. I was charged 99$ for a night in a huge room with a view the week of the 4th of july. A dream! It’s easy to stay on budget and visit the city and go shopping. Very affordable. I live in a small town in Canada and hotels are more way expensive than this. 3. The staff. Always smiling, making jokes and making the guests feel comfortable, but staying very polite and professional at the same time.4. The rooms. They are very modern looking but very simple, with every little useful things we need.5. It’s perfect. It’s all perfect. 5 stars, 10/10, would totally recommend to EVERYONE ",7/8/18,5
"I thought I was booking a higher starred hotel than what I was so ultimately I was disappointed on arrival. But first the good stuff - the staff on reception when we arrived were super lovely! I wish I remembered their names. It was my mum's birthday and the three of them that were there all made a fuss which she loved.It's in a good location, if you like Times Square. I think it's quite ideal for a first timer as it's central. I have previously been to New York hundreds of times but it was my mum's first time so I wanted her to have the real experience and she wanted to be central. You can get a small discount in some eateries just by showing your hotel room key (but you basically have paid extra for this - I'll explain later).I'm afraid that's probably all the good I could possibly say about this hotel.The noise is quite unbearable to be honest. I'm quite a heavy sleeper but even when I was trying to fall asleep I found it difficult with the noise. We had phone calls come through to the room a couple of times but nobody on the receiving end which was very annoying. The heating system in the rooms need updating badly! We were there in March so it was still freezing (for me) so I wanted the heating on all the time whilst there but the noise of the system is terrible. We couldn't sleep with it on it was that bad. Which meant I was quite cold at night. Make sure you don't get a room by the elevators (luckily I pleaded with reception to change our room) the noise is insufferable. Continuing on from the elevators, oh my god.. the amount of time wasted waiting for these elevators! I needn't say more than, if you're in a rush to leave or get back to your room, give yourself 20 minutes wait time for the elevator to come. There were extra hidden charges, beware! You can't really opt out of it, it includes the wifi, these silly water refillable things, discount at some local eateries in Times Square and maybe a couple of other things.All in all, visit New York, it's the best city in the world, but do not stay in this hotel. There are far nicer hotels for the same price if you're on a budget. I'd recommend staying in an area other than Times Square too as even if you stayed downtown, the subway is incredibly easy to use and convenient ",7/8/18,3
"We stayed at Row NYC and the convenience of location was perfect. I liked that we were offered an opportunity to upgrade our room, via email, and we gladly accepted a room with a view, at only a few dollars more per person. It was worth it. We could see the Hudson River from our room!! Check in was a snap and check out even easier. Room was comfy and I like the bright yellow with the gray accents. The music gave a vibrant hip vibe; felt like I was in the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas!!!! Blocks from the subway and around the corner from Times Square!! So much to do and see and EAT around this hotel!! I would definitely stay there again. ",7/8/18,5
"No frills, but for a comfortable bed, clean room, great location,and good rate, you can’t beat the Row. I also appreciate that the Row provides free water and refillable bottles. Why do you require that I write at least 200 words ",7/8/18,4
We came to NYC for Broadway and we couldn’t have picked a better location than Row NYC. The staff was very friendly and check in was quick and easy. The rooms are very small but clean (no one goes to NYC to stay in the room anyway!) and we found the noise to be minimal on the 22nd floor. We absolutely loved our first NYC experience and can’t wait to return. We will definitely book this hotel again and recommend it to our friends.,7/8/18,4
"The Row NYC is a very reasonably priced hotel in a fantastic location for Broadway. The room was small, but clean, tidy and comfortable. We had ‘deluxe room with city view’, which for only $10 more meant we we were on the 26th floor and could look out across a typical NY big building view. We queued up at the TKTS booth in Times Square - we arrived at 2.15 pm and so were very near the front of the long queue which had formed by 3pm when the office opened. But, we were rewarded with half price tickets for great seats in the ‘orchestra’ to watch the brilliant ‘The play that went wrong’ that evening.The hotel has a busy lobby, just like everywhere in NY, but we checked in without any real delay. Also, as we hadn’t charged anything to the room, we could just drop off the room keys in the express checkout box when we left. Another good feature of the hotel is that after checking out of our room, we could leave our luggage with them for free (well a small tip to thank the staff) and collect at the end of the day. The hotel is also just a 2 min walk from the Port Authority bus depot if you are bussing it to NY on the Peter Pan or Greyhound who use this Terminal. Only downside, the lifts are frustrating. You have to enter the floor you want to go to in a panel at the front and then are assigned a lift to wait for- you don’t just jump into the first lift to arrive. This system seemed to be less efficient to me. Overall, clean, tidy with a brilliant location for Broadway and Times Square ",7/8/18,4
Checked into a dirty room to be moved to a new room in their new room the AC didn’t work and they tried to tell me that they didn’t have anything available then when I complained more I was moved into a room that was not comparable to the room that I had paid fo,7/7/18,2
"Good value for your money. Nice rooms, especially those with a king size bed. Only negative thing is the noise from the airco and street when staying at the 9th floor.I guess the higher you stay the less you will hear from the street ",7/7/18,4
"my bathroom had mold or mildew on wall joining and small flying bugs coming out of drain. Ice maker did not work on my level had to go two levels down, good things it is right in the middle of town great location ",7/7/18,3
"Having stayed at the Row a couple of times last year, Im sorry to report some glaring hiccups on my recent visit. First of all, a ring that ive had for twenty five years disappeared on the one and only day I asked housekeeping to clean. I fear it was thrown away from the desk in the room. What's even more disappointing is the total lack of response from the lost or stolen department. I wrote an email immediately on Saturday June 30th reporting this. I tried calling but apparently no one picks up a phone there. My frustration didn't stop there.The Row mistakenly thinks that blaring music in the elevators 24/7 carries some appeal. It doesn't. In fact, it demonstrates a lazy resting on our laurels type attitude. Even worse, the gym. The skanky club music blares at all times making it impossible to listen to one's own music. I went to the front desk to ask someone to turn it down but there were over a dozen people in line. I then asked the concierge who wasn't doing anything and he literally looked at the front desk and said 'You'll have to ask them."" Fail, total fail. Another issue is the noise. I was put in a tenth floor corner room. I was quite excited at first because I liked the layout of the room but...the noise coming from the street, the horns and the sirens disturbed my sleep all night. The room had a connecting door to another room and the occupants of that room, a father and son spent a lot of time in the late night and early morning screaming at each other. It was a nightmare. Now, I love District M, I love the security guys around the elevators (though a distinctly sketchy guy did come up with my niece and I on the elevator one night never exiting and behaving very oddly) and the housekeepers were very nice overall. But a lack of response regarding my lost or stolen is beyond inappropriate - it's unprofessional and suspicious. I appreciate the Row's proximity to my relatives and to the theaters. But something's gone off here, and I will hesitate to ever book here again ",7/7/18,2
"Row NYC has great customer service. They answered all of my questions about the room before my trip, gave my friend a free upgrade so his room could be near mine, and did everything possible to ensure that our stay was pleasant. ",7/7/18,5
"공항 픽업이 무료라고 해서 갔더니 그걸 또 인터넷에 등록하고 뭐하고 엄청 복잡합니다. 로비에 컴퓨터가 있는데 그걸로는 등록도 안되고 해서 고생고생해서 전화로 등록했는데 기사가 안된다고 별안간에 화를 냅니다. 그래서 호텔이랑 픽업회사랑 전화로 싸우고 싸워서 환불은 해준다고 했지만 지금까지 못받았어요. 드러워서 안받음. 그거 말고도 체크인도 줄서서 하고, 지들끼리 친하다 생각하는 손님한테는 막 따로 친하게 굴고 다른 손님은 찬밥신세. 복도에서는 카페트가 오래된건지 이상한 냄새나고, 엘레베이터도 이상하고 방은 짐도 못펴놓을정도로 좁아터지고 그렇네요. 말아서 쓸수있는 물통 줬는데 그거만 좋음.. 방을 넓히지 못하면 침대를 하나 빼서 가격내리고 그냥 일인방으로 팔아요. 침대 두개 들어가지도 않는데 우겨넣지 마시고요.We got a coupon for Airport pickup and nobody had what that coupon is. We failed figure out by asking people from the front desk. Nobody had fuxx clue!!! So we searched the internet and struggled to get it registered. However the computer did not really work properly. So that I phoned them up and finally made it to be registered through the phone. After all that, we still failed to get a free ride to the airport since the driver did not have clue about the coupon again!! And he even yelled at us!!! Can you believe it???? We just paid for the ride and fought with the company and we still didn't get a refund for that after they admitted that I deserve refund.I don't care about the small money I paid for so that did not send the account information but I am determined to let people know about what happened there. If you have some contract with other company, you must know what is going on. Don't fool people around! Beside that, the room was cramp not being enough for us to put our luggage. The corridor smells awful. I will never go there for vacation again!. The most horrible place ever ",7/7/18,3
"You cant beat this midtown location. Rooms are small, but clean and comfortable. Just be aware there is a facilities fee which adds about 30 bucks a night to your costs. When the price is right, it still a deal....but of the room rate is at your budget, you'll be disappointed ",7/7/18,4
"The room was disgraceful.The overall cleanliness as soon as we walked in was poor. Upon further expection me and my partner found mould on the blinds and what appeared to be a sick stain on the floor. I would like to point out that my partner does suffer from asthma and something like mould even just on a blind can become a catalyst for something much more Sinster. With this in mind we went down stairs to reception to see what could be done. When we approached staff about the condition of our room they offered to send a cleaning service up but could only do so at 9pm, many hours after we had checked in. When we arrived back later that evening we found the only thing house cleaning had done was re make the bed, the mould and stain still remained much to our disappointment. My partner then went down to the reception to resolve the issues, only to be told that there was nothing they could do as the hotel was fully booked until tomorrow. However later we checked online on numerous websites that all stated the hotel had multiple rooms available. This left us very frustrated as you can imagine. Once again we approached the staff to be told that this ‘is not how the system works’ and we would have to stick with the room we had. Thanks god we only had to stay for two nights! So overall all the staff were very unhelpful, the room was very disappointing in size and cleanliness and left us questioning my partners health, which made the overall experience of the stay very unsatisfactory ",7/7/18,1
Great location near Times Square with many restaurant choices and theaters in walking distance. Staff were very helpful and knowledgeable and rooms were clean and neat. Check-in was quick and efficient.,7/6/18,5
Close to Times Square and fabulous restaurants. Very convenient. Exceptional staff very willing to help and make your stay rewarding. Honest housekeepers!! left my ring in the hotel by mistake and it was there when I returned! You won't be disappointed to stay there. Cool elevators!,7/6/18,4
"The location is great. The subway is right outside and it was a nice walk to places we wanted to go to (10-15 minute walks). However, check-in was really slow. There were 4 staff members helping clients and they kept shouting to each other what rooms they were trying to book and taking rooms away from each other. It felt very disorganized. Internet was TERRIBLE. It cannot disconnecting. Room was quite small.. probably around 8'x5' kind of dimension. But the location was great. But I will probably not stay here agai ",7/5/18,1
Beyond satisfied and more than we expected for the low price! The Row delivered in every way! You cannot go wrong choosing to stay here. Its smack in the middle of everything you could possibly imagine and anything you crave to eat day or night.,7/5/18,5
Convenient to time square but without all the noise. Nights were peaceful and quite. Multiple places to eat without even leaving the hotel.The bar located downstairs is a nice bonus as well. Subway is located just across the street for quick access to the metro.,7/5/18,4
"Stayed a week and found the Row fantastic in every way, great service, nice room with views over Time Square and food outlets on site with discounts for guests. Stone throw from Time Square and Broadway shows and other handy sites. Highly recommend as pricing was also a bonus and very reasonable for the location. Will definitely stay again on our next visit ",7/5/18,5
"OK if you like crowds and 2* accommodation whilst paying 4* price this would suit you. Management take no notice of complaints. Very limited light in corridors and lifts to disguise poor condition. Very basic rooms, no hanging space for towels. ",7/5/18,1
We got there as an emergency stay. My family and I were extremely tired andrealized it only slept 2. Christina and Paola made our trip even better with their awesome customer service. They upgraded us when it was more difficult to do since it was on a Friday. They both made out stay even better. Thank you Christina and Paola for you service and quick problem solving,7/5/18,5
"The location is good. The staff was helpful when asked questions. The rooms are small, picture a cruise ship room. The elevators have a smell to them. We had to call for linen. The door latches seemed loose. The caulking in the bathroom is laughable. It was an average hotel ",7/5/18,3
"This was our third stay at the Row. If you want to be near Broadway, it's a great choice. Rooms are clean, comfortable but small ( think cruise ship ). Staff is friendly and accommodating. Only hint: don't book all the rooms for your party on one credit card ( although to me that seems easier ). Problem was that I was charged an ",7/5/18,4
"Don't be fooled by the lobby and restaurant...it's lipstick on a pig. When I called to complain about my room smelling like an old bar, they sent two employees to check it out...and they agreed. One of them left me with a bottle of air freshener, which only worked for 15 minutes or so. I got about 2 hours sleep that night because the smell kept waking me up. They didn't have a room to move me to, so I checked out and found another (more affordable) hotel two blocks away that was 10x as nice as Row. I wouldn't have booked Row if our convention didn't use it as a default hotel when signing up - I'll certainly let the convention know to ditch them.The rooms are also dated and dirty. The wallpaper decor is cheap and overused - it's all over the hallways and bedrooms. Makes it look like the designer was trying way too hard to be ",7/5/18,1
The location is great and the variety of food within the same building is wonderful. I felt secure with a guard being posted in front of the elevators in the evenings. We had to show our room key to prove that we were actually staying there. Our room smelled like mold though--that is my only problem with it,7/5/18,4
"We were in the City for the hottest day of the year. ROW NYC was a welcome retreat from the fun and heat of the day. Well done on the design and services. Retrofitted older hotel for new modern vibe. Rooms are small, but that's NYC. Lobby Bar and adjacent City Eats Cafe were perfect! Location couldn't be beat ",7/4/18,5
1-When I arrived the Doorman pulled opened my car door and grabbed my suitcase before I paid the Taxi Driver. He was in a hurry to get another Hotel guest in the taxi I was vacating.2-The check in person gave me no instructions on how the elevator or any knowledge about the hotel works and was not pleasant at all.3-When I got to me room I did not have a Shower curtain in the bathroom. The room was not ready. also there was not any information about the hotel in the room.4-The People that work the Bar area were the MOST pleasant part of my experience.It would have been nice to know that they did not have in room coffee/tea maker,7/4/18,3
"What a fantastic location, so close to Times Square and plenty of other attractions. Rooms are small but comfortable, only there to sleep. Had no issues whilst there and would definitely stay there again ",7/3/18,5
"Well, overall it is a nice hotel but it is missing many things for the money they are charging. I would like to see a kitchen where we can order food if we didn’t feel like going out, and also having things like a coffee maker will also be nice. ",7/3/18,3
"Great hotel. Very convenient. Food court options very convenient, good value, great quality, and great to have options easily without much higher costs. Only issue was size of bathroom. It was really tight ",7/3/18,4
"We had a great stay at ROW NYC this last week in June 2018. We stayed in room 900 right outside of the elevators (with the cool decorated door as many noted). It was a decent sized room with a comfy king bed. The location is great, the rooms are clean, WiFi worked just fine and it's nice and quiet! Thankful for a perfectly relaxing stay with good A/C on a hot week too. Elevators are super speedy too with no long waits ",7/3/18,5
"We enjoyed our room overlooking Time Square! We were close to our theater, the bakeries, the Time Square shops,and everything we wanted to do on a weekend trip! Just a few blocks from Amtrak Station! The City Kitchen breakfast overlooking the City each morning was a highlight ",7/3/18,5
"We used mobile check in but when we arrived at the hotel, the key card making machine wasn’t working so we had to go to the desk anyways. Big queues with only two slow members of staff. The room was okay. Some items of furniture were a bit tatty like the drawer had bits missing from the corners. Wasn’t too significant but makes it seem like they don’t care about the room appearance. The bathroom had mould on the wall/ ceiling. The air conditioner was loud but this was expected & we’re heavy sleepers so it didn’t bother us. During our stay we had to get new room keys FOUR times. They kept not working. We came back to the room really hungry, wanting to dropping our shopping bags off and head back out for food but the keys weren’t working. So we had to go back to the lobby to get new keys. These keys didn’t work so we had to go back down again and someone was sent up to try the door themselves. It didn’t work. Then an engineer was called to replace the lock/ key system on the door. Overall this took about an hour and a half. All we wanted was to leave the bags and get food but we ended up not even being able to get into the room. It was incredibly frustrating but nobody seemed to be apologetic about it or even care. The WiFi was hit and miss even though you have to pay for it. We went to use the printers and none of the four printers were working. Someone informed a member of staff and it took about twenty minutes for someone to actually come fix the printers. The day before checking out my key card stopped working again. I went to the lobby to get a scales to make sure my luggage wasn’t too heavy and they didn’t have one. This is the first hotel that I’ve ever stayed in that didn’t have something as simple as scales. When asked if they have one we were just told “no we don’t.” It felt like the staff didn’t care about you, once they had your money. On checkout we were asked about the stay and said it was just okay. This wasn’t queried any further which just made it further feel like the staff didn’t care about their guests. Yes the location is nice but there are so many other hotels in a similar/ better location. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to stay here. I know I will also just receive the automated “sorry your stay wasn’t pleasant” response but it’s really not good enough. ",7/3/18,1
"the service was excellent, no further improvement is required, the hotel complies with what is required to have a pleasant stay and is close to two blocks from time square and Broadway, eta near everything ",7/3/18,5
Great stay for family with a wheelchair bound child. The staff was friendly and so accommodating. The ROW was very clean and a perfect fit for our needs. The ROW was the perfect location for attending the theater in NYC. There were also good food choice in the area and easy taxi service to all the sites!! We LOVED the ROW,7/3/18,4
"We stayed here for a bachelorette party for one night stay. It is a good location and easy to get cabs. The staff opening doors and hailing cabs for us were very helpful and nice. The rooms were OK - small like most NYC hotels, and noticeably dirty carpet in spots as well some small stains on comforter. Bathroom was fine. Hotel lobby and food offerings were great. Once late night convenience store inside which was helpful. ",7/2/18,3
"Very good Hotel, good location, very good services this is the place to stay if you want to stay in New York directly in Times Square! I always recommanded this hotel and never desapointed. Room always clean and confortable and this time we have a chance to have the view on a beautiful fireworks directly from our rooms!!! best weekend ever ",7/2/18,5
"The hotel is literally 2 minutes from Time Square, surrounded by many theaters and well communicated. Service was great both in reception and the different bars they have. The only negative point would be that you can clearly hear your neighbor, I was there during the Super Bowl and the girls in the room next to ours were chatting and screaming all night. The view from our room was amazing, even though we were at the opposite side from Time Square, but you could clearly see the skyline. Cleaning personal was so nice too. Definitely I would come back ",7/2/18,4
"2nd time staying at ROW and it is my favorite hotel to stay in NYC. It is 2 blocks off Time Square so super close yet gets you away from the hustle and bustle. We love staying here as it is so hip and unique and not your old stodgy hotel. There is quick easy transportation with Uber & Taxi at the door and subway & bus within 1 block of the hotel. You feel very safe and the City Kitchen which is connected to the hotel is like a food court with 7-10 different restaurants all in one place, reasonable prices and something for everyone ",7/2/18,5
"You have to improve a lot. The hotel is very well located but too dirty, noisy and dark. Bathrrom is old, hot water is not always, is an small space. Music at the elevator is irritating. Many things to improve ",7/1/18,1
"We love staying at The Row NYC... it’s so close to everything! It’s also very affordable and we feel safe here! It’s also close to Broadway Dance Center, Times Square and Shake Shack=} The staff is friendly and the lobby smells amazing when you walk in!! ",7/1/18,5
"My client booked me at this hotel and as soon as I saw the address I was concerned. This hotel is in the heart of the yuck in NYC. People accosting you with bus tours as soon as you walk outside the door and noise of cheering at midnight as people wait for broadway stars to exit the nearby theatres. The rooms are small, which isn't a big deal, but I have a few other issues with the hotel. 1) When I checked in the woman said she was going to give me a little upgrade since I was booked into a standard room near the elevators. I got to my room and I was directly across from the elevators (2623). So she either made a mistake or had no idea what she was doing. It was 11:30 at night so I just let it go. But you should know that these rooms are very noisy. You can hear the doors opening and closing and the music they blast inside. 2) As soon as I opened the bathroom door the smell hit me. There was a MAJOR disgusting smell coming from the pipes or something. It smelled like death. It persisted the whole time I was there. I was going to try to switch rooms the second day but there was a line for check-in and it was moving very slowly so I aborted the mission since I was really only in the room from 9pm til 7am.3) The wi-fi continually blocked me for visiting sites it viewed unsafe... One of them was mailchimp - - a very common email automation tool. Another was a non-profit site. Once blocked, you had to wait 10 minutes to log back on which killed my nighttime productivity since it kept happening.The price is very cheap for NY so I shouldn't be too surprised that it's not a 5-star hotel but I would never stay there again. On the plus side, housekeeping does a good job, (the rooms are clean) and although the rooms are small they're functional ",7/1/18,2
"the hotel has an excellent location. The attention of the reception staff is slow, long lines are formed. The cleanliness of the rooms is bad. The cleaning staff makes a minimum effort. the rooms should have coffee maker ",7/1/18,3
"Great value hotel. Great location at 8th avenue with restaurants, bars, convenience stores, gift shops, supermarkets. Near Majestic theatre (Phantom of the Opera)!!!! Times Square is at a very shork walking distance! Good quality/price option. I would go back to this place, if I go again to NYC ",7/1/18,4
"We were right around the corner from our theater...very convenient tow all of the sights, theaters, time square, Lincoln tunnel and although the valet is pricey, it was excellent service, I would stay here again.. ",7/1/18,4
"in the heart of times square , not quiet , but you can sleep. Good service. they take care of nice details & design . Nice bar and food options. Security also works. check out and ckeck in was easy , and staff was warm and helpful. ",7/1/18,4
"The hotel has a great location, great cleaning, but the bed and pillows need to improve a lot. For a family is very important a room with window, helps to get bigger and more comfortable.The employee Marcelo was fantastic and helped us a lot. ",6/30/18,4
"Very good location. We were aware of the extra fees to be paid on arrival which we couldn't take advantage of as we were only there 1 night but the total price was fair for where we were but still disappointing. Rooms were clean, wifi was good but the air con units in the room and outside the window were pretty noisy. It did the job for our night there and we would probably stay there again ",6/30/18,4
This hotel charges guest a facilities fee there is no mention of it at checkin or check out. I could not take advantage of the benefits because the frontline staff made no mention of it. Complaint handled poorly blame shifted to the third party booking agent for not making it clear,6/29/18,1
"Decent (though small) room in a decent building with a great location for less money than other places. If you are excited by the perks (e.g., free shuttle to airport) be sure to read the fine print ... after the hassle of a web shopping cart and printing a paper ticket, I discovered I couldn't use the shuttle on the day of my departure because I needed to arrange my pickup more than 24 hours in advance. ",6/29/18,3
"I had planned my trip to New York as a surprise to my girlfriend and i was planning to propose while out there. We stayed at The Row NYC in January 2018 and on check in our room was upgraded to a Premium City view, which was amazing. We stayed on the 25th floor and the room was spacious and the en suite bathroom was a very good size. We had city views from 4 separate windows. The room was clean and comfortable, and the location was exactly what we needed. Its a short walk (few minutes) to Times Square and the Port Authority Bus terminal. The food court in the hotel is worth a visit and highly recommend the donuts. For the price of the rooms and the location you cannot get much better for your money.I have ready reviews and some bad but don't let this put you off (at the end of the day everyone has a different opinion) We loved our stay here and if book a Premium Deluxe room you wont be disappointed. Ultimately, if you are going to New York and spending most of your time in your room, then you are doing New York wrong ",6/29/18,5
"Very well located : 4 minutes walking from Times square and subwayRooms are very small for 3 : impossible to entirely open you luggage ! but cleanFountain water is appreciableNo human atmosphere in general, just busines ",6/29/18,3
"Stayed for 3 nights. The only good thing is the location. Rooms are tiny.. had a room with a view of a wall. Noises air con which you need as room stifling. Tiny bathroom which was not clean and stank of damp. Room had not been hovered and didn’t look very clean on stay. Reception staff miserable and not friendly. Cleaners knock room before 8am and felt rushed to leave room on last morning. I knew about extra charge but think this is wrong to charge for WiFi , calls and gym when didn’t need it. Definitely will return to New York but not to this hotel ",6/29/18,2
"I’d previously stayed here before when it was the Milford Plaza so had a good idea of what to expect. Rooms are small and cheaply renovated and the nightly rate is expensive for the standard. The bathroom was shabby and tiny but adequate enough for us- I imagine anyone plus sized would struggle to turn around in the shower or be comfortable on toilet as it was jammed right up against a wall. You are basically paying for the location so if you keep your expectations low, you won’t be too disappointed. The a/c unit in our room was ridiculously noisy but it was hot so we had to keep it on and just suffer with it. The worst aspect of the hotel was there weren’t enough staff on the front desk to deal with the volume of customers checking in, out and general enquires (deactivated room key cards etc). Most of time we needed assistance we had to wait in long queues and constantly witnessed people who were confused/arguing about the additional ‘resort fee’. Not a problem for us as we were already aware but it would probably make more sense to include the ‘fee’ (since it’s compulsory) in the nightly rate to free up staff and avoid the arguments. What’s the point is making the rates look cheaper? It only irritates people who may be unaware of additional costs they may not have budgeted for. Overall this time we had a pretty average stay, it wasn’t terrible but wasn’t great either. Next time we visit NY I think we’d probably consider staying elsewhere unless the price at the Row was significantly cheaper than what we paid this time. ",6/29/18,3
"Hotel was lovely and clean, rooms were quiet small but we didn’t mind too much. Location was ideal with Times Square just around the corner and the lobby had such a good smell. Perfect for a young couple or friends. Carlos bakery and port authority was just down the road which was so handy if your going to jersey gardens. Good value for money and I would recommend. ",6/29/18,4
"I was extremely disappointed in the lack of communication between the Row and their reservation specialists. When I tried to have questions answered about a nonprofit/corporate rate I was told I would be sent an email from the hotel to help me learn more. I had to call back 3X's over several days, one time while i was at the hotel prior to check out, and never received the emails. When I attempted to speak with the managers at the hotel (in person), no one seemed to know what I was talking about. Even when i put them on the phone with their (the Row's) reservation specialist. This is extremely unprofessional to not be able to communicate as a staff to assist your consumer. No one seemed to be able to help me. Also, be sure to check your bill when you leave to make sure you aren't being charged for items you didn't request ",6/28/18,1
Location of the hotel is super!! 4 yrs ago also stayed at ROW. At that time the hotel was recently renovated. We could now clearly notice that the hotel needs some small renovation again. Room was not properly cleaned every day and also the bathroom was not smelling fresh anymore. There was mold on the ceiling and also sides of the tub. We stayed here for 10 days and there was lots of duts on the table and side of the bed. Next time would seriously consider other hotels in the neighborhood as well,6/27/18,3
Did not get our room they transferred us to a new hotel. We had to make the manager pay for our uber and the ride was canceled midway through the trip we were abandoned on the street with our luggage,6/27/18,1
Pictures show more room than what you get. Wish they showed the bathroom that would have been funny. Staff working there were the best part of the trip. Thank you for your hospitality. Wish the room was set for 4 guests when you booked it for four. Had to ask for two towels.,6/27/18,3
"Stayed here last week and I have to say its perfectly located in times square. The rooms are tiny and getting to sleep at night was a bit of a nightmare with the sound of all the traffic outside but its New York so what do you expect. Getting to here from Newark airport is a bit of a nightmare. Taxi will cost you a fortune, almost 100 dollars, so if you want to avoid that you'll have to take the train which again is a pain if you have a suitcase and everything. Overall we enjoyed our stay here, its location is great but again as I said don't be expecting massive rooms, its New York ",6/27/18,3
"I already did in previous topic my opinion.I just reaffirm that the Receptionist Marcelo helped us very much, with indications, doubts and detailed rules of the hotel.I would like to thank the security of the Hotel, who treated us very well during the hours we asked for help ",6/27/18,4
The hotel it was very expensive if you take a consideration the size of the room and the few of quality of things that you can do in the hotel. Bar/restaurant are not open 24hrs for example. The location is the strongest amenity but the hotel need more things. Security during the night was good. I will come back in the future to this hotel,6/27/18,3
"This was my second stay at Row NYC. My first stay, about two years ago was mediocre so I figured I would try the hotel again since it would only be for one night. My experience was terrible- the check in process took about 30 minutes because of the long lines, there isn't any air conditioning in the dark and frankly creepy looking hallways. It takes 15 minutes to get an elevator to go downstairs to the lobby.My room itself had air conditioning, however it was so loud that it kept me up all night. There was also a weird staticky noise coming from one of the outlets all night. Room could use some renovating as well - dingy carpet and tile and TV was hanging crooked on the wall. I would suggest that if you are looking for a hotel, to look elsewhere. Spend a little more money to have a better experience. Needless to stay I will not be giving this hotel another chance ",6/27/18,1
"From the looks of the lobby and the pictures of the room, you would think this is a new hotel. But it is clearly an old hotel that's been badly/cheaply renovated. Lobby is great. Rooms are tiny, wall paper is dirty, carpet under the bed is filthy, bottom of the bathtub was bizarrely soft, faucet was loose, bathroom door handle was loose, weird foliage growing on the top of the bathroom baseboards. Very uncomfortable beds, low to the floor.The price of these rooms is solely based on the location because the rooms themselves are absolutely not worth 1464$ for a 3 night stay ",6/27/18,2
"Very Happy with Row NYC, rooms were nice and modern but small, but was perfect for our needs, as you are in NYC so didnt spend a lot of time there, location couldn’t be better, 1 street down from Times Square, woukd book again and again for future visit ",6/27/18,4
One of the best hotels views I’ve ever had 24th floor . Rain water walk in shower. Large comfy beds. Staff remembered who I was and felt like a tight family. It was a special occasion for my friend and the hotel went above an beyond expectations. Thank you for the amazing hospitality,6/26/18,5
"When you see the pictures online, trust me you ""think"" it looks good and all. However, it is quite deceiving when you see it for real. First, the front desk employees seemed like they did not want to work at all. There was a waiting line, but it did not matter because they were just working really slow.The security man that was standing there was very mean & he was not professional because he had an attitude when he asked to see my key card. Second, when I got my key card I did not know that the elevator needed me to press on which floor I was going to because the front desk did not tell me anything about it. I just thought it was a simple elevator and that inside it would have the floor's numbers to press on. There was nothing and I ended up on the 16th floor. I was confused with the elevator because I still could not figure it out yet. We were stuck there for 5 minutes. There was nobody to ask for help or anything. When we finally got down to the 1st floor; I had to ask the security man how to get to the 11th floor & he looked at me all rude and he did not say anything, but just pressed the number 11. Third, when we got to our floor & I saw the room. That is when I was so shocked how dirty the bed sheets were with weird stains on it. The sheets stink like it was never washed.The AC vent on the side of the window was popping off the AC unit. You could not even adjust where you wanted the AC to blow at. The window had water stain from the outside, so I could not even take a picture of the view.The desk was not clean at all because I could see cup stains & dust.The shower head in the bathroom was so slow when I turned on the water. It took me a long time to wash my mid-length hair. If there is too many people using the water, it is even worst to take a shower because the temperature keep changing like too cold or too hot.All the power outlets were messed up because every time we tried to plug something, it would work for couple seconds and stopped. We just ended up not plugging anything. My mom had to sleep with a CPAP machine that required to be plugged in, and she could not use it that night because of this issue.I needed a fork, knife, & plate to eat my fruits, but when I called the front desk. They said they did not have ""room service"", so I had to go ask somewhere else. It is my first time that I stayed at a hotel & the front desk tells me that there is no room service because I never heard of that my entire life.You have to believe me when I tell you that you should not even try to get a room here at all. It is too expensive for a hotel like this & for sure it is not worth your money. If you are an individual who cares about the cleanliness of your room & the friendliness of the staff; FIND ANOTHER HOTEL ",6/26/18,1
"I was in this hotel for 9 days, very well located, I was very well received by the Brazilian Marcelo, that makes all the difference. The room was cleaned everyday, the elevators worked well throughout the period I've been there. for being such a big hotel this is very important ",6/26/18,4
I would like to receive a warmer reception on the front desk. The Clerk was eating at her labor site and almost I did not understand what she said. I think those kind og things should not happen. Room too small,6/26/18,3
"Good location, friendly and helpful stuff but small rooms, rooms not as fancy as on hotel pictures. Room did not had a teapot or refrigerator. It is a bit expansive for this quality of the room....... ",6/26/18,3
"The title says it all really. The room was comfortable and clean but very basic even though I upgraded to a superior queen room. The air conditioning was extremely noisy and I had to turn it off at night otherwise I had no chance of sleeping, but this meant that it got hot in the room. The location is fantastic - one block from Times Square. The hotel bar is small, dark and not very inviting. The main issue is that they are not set up for chip and pin on credit cards. When I checked out I was unable to use the card I would have liked to as my card provider declined the transaction due to the amount and the lack of chip and pin. I was lucky that I had second card that was accepted otherwise I would have had no means of paying my bill ",6/26/18,3
This is an excellent hotel to stay at... it is in the heart of NYC... walking distance from Times Square and Broadway... the location is superb and always buzzing... this also makes it a bit expensive but worth the stay...,6/26/18,5
"We had a one night stay in New York on our way to Washington for a family holiday. We booked the Row NYC based on the pictures and images shown on their website but disappointingly, the reality was very different and the hotel fell well below our expectations. As well as a slow (and not particularly helpful) Reception team, the lobby, lift and landing areas were dirty. Our room was extremely basic, not very clean and one of the quilts was marked and stained. In addition, we could not find a cold water / ice machine that worked anywhere on the landings and floors around us. We are regular travellers and do appreciate that this is a busy, city centre hotel but for the price paid, we expected something much better. Needless to say, we would not recommend and will not be staying at The Row NYC again ",6/25/18,2
"Hotel was in a great location and clean. Rooms are quite small but there was no problem with noise. Not so good was that a deposit was posted to my credit card which was unexpected as I had been told my credit card would not be charged unless I had not given appropriate time for cancellation. The room had no channel description for the tv or informational material regarding nearby churches, medical, etc.. ",6/25/18,3
"Location was fantastic. Adjacent to fantastic City Kitchen. Fun lobby scene. Rooms are basic but super clean. The check in kiosks were out of order, resulting in a long check in wait, but we're back online the next day. And so many friendly staff. Fantastic overall experience ",6/25/18,4
"To start off, we were unaware of the high taxes in Newyork as Booking.com failed to include them in final quote. We were already $400 over our budget after these taxes. We booked a deluxe double room for the 3 nights, but it was far from deluxe. We did not have any floor space to even fit our suitcases. The bathroom had an unstable sliding wooden frame as a door. We requested a room change as this basic box room was not slightly up to our satisfaction. So they moved us to slightly better and bigger room with a view of the city. I shared a double bed with my friend and the second I got into it I noticed my side of the bed was wet my friend informed me that she had a shower and sat in her towel on my side of the bed so I took no notice. When I woke up in the morning the bed was still wet. I unrolled the covers and noticed a big yellow wet stain on the sheets and mattress protector that was obviously urine from the previous guest. Housekeeping failed to see this. I was disgusted and went to reception to inform the manager. She did not bat an eyelid or show any remorse for our situation! Absolutely deplorable! I would not recommend this hotel! Avoid if all possible. Not worth the 4 star rating they claim to have. ",6/25/18,1
"DO NOT BE DECEIVED BY THE NICE-LOOKING FRONT LOBBY! This hotel has small and dirty cramped rooms with incredibly rude and unhelpful front desk staff. They messed up with my reservation twice and made me wait a total of 12 hours for my requested room, and they did not do comp me a single thing to make up for their errors. Front desk never picks up their phone. The only good thing about this hotel is the convenient location in Theatre District. Otherwise, would NOT recommend or stay again ",6/25/18,2
"This was my 2nd time at Row NYC and with the competitive rates, convenient location, clean & comfortable rooms, I'd be happy to return. The Row provides everything I need for a quick business overnight trip ",6/25/18,4
The rooms are small but the location is unbeatable. Rooms are clean and staff are friendly. Restaurant (food court) attached is very convenient. I stay here regularly when I'm in the city! I would highly recommend this hotel as long as you aren't claustrophobic,6/25/18,4
"Fun hotel bustling with a NY vibe. The location in the heart of the theater district can't be beat. Great staff and food court. The clever, efficient elevator system delivers guests to chic, clean rooms. Love the NY murals on the walls ",6/25/18,5
"The ROW is perfectly located for your first sightseeing trip to New York. Times Square, Subway station and Porth Authority Bus Terminal is 5 min away. The rooms are small which is typical for this city. It is enough to get a good nights sleep when staying in the upper floors. We were in floor 20. Of course the city is still to hear: Fire trucks, people cheering, ambulances. It’s a big city so you need to count that in. Our room was a free upgrade to premium and I have only one point to mention: We had high temperatures during our stay and a refrigerator would have been very useful for cooling drinks. But that‘s a nice to have feature. There is this service fee for $34 per night you need to pay. This is for example for WiFi or the fitness center. If you plan on buying souvenirs you can use your guest card for a discount in the shop downstairs. We enjoyed our stay and can recommend it. ",6/25/18,4
"this is the most terrible hotel i have ever been. housekeeper never clean the room, never change bed sheet, also they leave dirty used cup on the table for us to use it. i don't know if new towels were actually used one that i used it last night ",6/24/18,1
For my first time it was a great experience for me and my lady friend we really enjoyed ourselves very very much hope to be back in two more weeks this time instead of one day my birthday week hope for 2 days,6/24/18,5
"Row NYC...great location for subway, theater. restaurants, shopping etc. Comfortable room, felt safe; Beautiful sorroundings I highly recomend. We went sight seeing, to theater, and ate well. We easily got where we wanted to be... either by walking or using public transportation ",6/24/18,5
"Good location, great price, comfortable rooms and helpful staff. Cheap eats all around the hotel and very close to times square. Only used the room to crash at night, was at work the rest of the time ",6/24/18,5
"Disappointed and will NOT be using again!!!! $137 to use WIFI!!!! Read on....Having used this hotel in 2004 when it was formerly known as The Milford Plaza, I decided to go back and revisit The Row NYC as it had been refurbished. Upon arriving, I noticed it had been given a modern twist although it’s staircase and front entrance still had the same look. The rooms had been given a freshen up but the air conditioning units were still the same and the bathroom looked similar apart from a few differences but the beds were comfy.As we checked in we were asked to give our passports and a credit card (standard for hotels) and I was informed there was a $50 holding charge on the card for damages and would be refunded if there was no issue and if we wanted to use Wifi we had to enter our room ID and surname to log on. The holding charge sounded standard so I was fine with that.Now this is where my disappointment kicks in... Upon checking out I was told the total charge was $137 so when I looked at the receipt issued as we were getting into a taxi for the airport it was for a Facilities Fee for the Wifi and Gym (although we never use the gym!) and it was charged at $30 per day PLUS sales and City Tax. FOR WIFI!!! And worst of all this was NOT explained to us when we checked in.... if the words used were “just to let you know to use our facilities such as Wifi and the Gym it’s thirty dollars a day” we would have said no or at least been aware of what we were incurring. And when I previously visited in 2004 there was no charge like this.In this day and age where WiFi is free in all places of the world not making a Facilities Fee clear is a very sneaky con and it’s like getting extra money out of customers so they can pay for the refurbishment the hotel has had done. It’s left a real bad taste in my mouth and I will not EVER return to this hotel and recommend all other people to be aware of this if they use it ",6/24/18,2
"Location was right around the corner from the Majestic and Sardies, that is why we chose it. But it needs upgrading and the room was not cleaned properly. I do think if they updated some things it would be a very nice place ",6/24/18,3
"The check in was confusing. We came in early in the morning and received an email to check in early for $50. We paid it but our room wasn't ready until after 4pm. The kiosks to check in did not work so we had to wait in a very long line to check in which sucked when you fly overnight. The rooms are very small and there are not amenities like coffee machines. We asked for hot water and had to pay $8 at the bar. The worst part was the air conditioning. It was working when we go to the room, but after leaving and coming back it had stopped working. We called to have someone fix it. We left for a couple of hours hoping it would be fixed when we go back, but they had not fixed it. We then called again and the entire air conditioner had to be replaced. Well it worked, but it wouldn't shut off so it was below 65 degrees in the room. We asked them to come fix it again so all they could do was shut it off. So we were miserable all night. We tried to open the window, but it was screwed shut. For $400 a night we expected MUCH better ",6/23/18,1
"The rooms are modern but small, seems average size for NYC though. Very clean, location was ideal - just at Hell’s Kitchen and Broadway, 10 min walk from Times Square. The subway was across the road also. ",6/23/18,5
"I came to stay here for 3 nights and for the money we paid (over $1000) it was extremely disappointing. When we went into our room the bed sheets were dirty, I had to call guest services 4 times to get them changed as they were not answering the phone. The room was also very small and not very clean, there were stains on the walls and pubic hair in the shower. I had also paid to have a ""large double bed"" however the bed that we were provided with looked like a standard double with one side against the wall as the room was so small. I would like to add that this was one of the hotels mid price rooms, not the cheapest option. The air conditioning in the room was also sub-par. The temperature controls on it made no difference and it only blew out very cold air directly at the bed, you could also not change the speed at which air was blown out. The shower has also been built in rather an impractical way as it has no door, this means that whenever you have a shower it makes the toilet paper wet. There was also a loud constant rumbling noise, we think that it was coming from the hotels main air conditioning system, it was loud enough to keep us awake at night. On the plus side the staff that we encountered were pleasant, but difficult to get hold of. Overall for the money we paid we were disappointed with our experience. The room was of the standard that you would expect in a cheap hostel. I would have been happy paying $60 a night for this room. The only possible justification for the price we paid was its location near times square, however this does not excuse the lack of cleanliness ",6/23/18,2
"Great location, minutes for many Broadway theaters, steps from the E subway stop. Bright, clean room and bath. “Room with a view” had a great city view. Good (fast) elevators. Excellent food options in the building ",6/23/18,5
"After reading all the reviews I was really skeptical about staying at this hotel. I would complain to my wife that I know it’s going to be so dirty when we get there. Surprisingly the room was pretty nice I had a great view and the beds were made and really clean.Now don’t get me wrong the hotel is a little on the older side but it was very clean and the walk to Times square was nothing. You have everything around you that you need while staying in New York City, all the restaurants, all the top-notch stores, all the bodegas, any pizza shop you may want to eat at. Everything was really convenient and I would definitely stay here again and suggest this location to anyone that visits New York City! Please do not go off of the reviews for this location experience it for yourself ",6/23/18,5
"Row is very good located, close to Times Square and Broadway's shows. Also close to the 42st metro station. You can find everything you need. The only thing i would suggest is that Row should have a frigobar inside the Row, although it is not a big issue because you can have easy meals in the hotel's restaurant ",6/23/18,4
"You don’t feel welcome here, hospitality is a word front desk staff or security staff never heared of. Security thinks they are nightclub bouncers, very impolite when asking to see your room key before entering the elevators. I’m too old for this kind of attitude and treatment. Your hotel should be your retreat from the hussle and bussle and this is not the experience you get. This is more the shady nightclub feeling ",6/23/18,2
"Very much liked the bathroom and the elevator system. Stay overall was pleasant. Very busy hotel with lots of people coming and going . Bus tour very close by, train station , Times Squares , many entertainment , Theaters, restaurants etc ",6/22/18,4
My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our 7 night stay at this hotel. You are in the heart of NY with short walks to the theatres and restaurants.The staff were all very helpful and friendly. We wouldn't definitely stay here again for a trip to New Yor,6/22/18,4
"I'm not sure where to begin but this may have been the worst hotel experience I've ever had. I travel quite a bit for business/personal trips and have stayed in all inclusive resorts along with several NY hotels previously for business. Unfortunately, this hotel will be on my DO NOT recommend list for as long as I have the power to advise people to stay away. I checked into this hotel this past Sun for a 2 night stay for business. On my first night upon arrival I was forced to switch rooms multiple times as each room that was given to me had bugs flying around as I tried to rest comfortably in the bed the night before work. After multiple trips downstairs and having to pack my bags and change rooms I was given a room that had no flies but at this point it was past 1 am and I was exhausted from the hassle and couldn't sleep comfortably. The worst part about this experience is I didn't feel like I was given a good answer as to why this was happening. I was simply just given a new room every time. To make matters worse I returned home from my trip only to find out that this hotel charged my credit card an additional $150 in resorts fees!!! I'm beyond appalled and disgusted with this entire experience and would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place in NY. I travel to NY quite often as my company is headquartered there and will do everything in my power moving forward to make sure no one I know or work with chooses this hotel along with anyone who is happy to listen. It was easily the worst hotel experience I've had in all my travels and cant remember dealing with such nonsense at any other establishment ",6/22/18,1
"This was a wonderful hotel. Right in the heart of midtown close to Times Square, but just far enough away to be out of the craziness of the herds of tourists. Two blocks from a major subway station (about a 3 minute walk). Updated, modern hotel. Very clean and great housekeeping staff. Great food options in the lobby at your fingertips for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! I will definitely be staying here again ",6/21/18,4
"The Row NYC is a wonderful hotel to stay in. It is right in the heart of midtown between Hell's Kitchen and Times Square. The rooms are small, but I was hardly there as i was taking in the sights.The best thing about the hotel was Bartender Jaret Jackson. A very pleasant young man who gives his all every time I stay at the Row NYC. His wonderful demeanor and great personality makes my stay that much more enjoyable. Overall I would rate my experience a 9 out of 10 ",6/21/18,5
Great hotel service and cleanliness. Staff very attentive and polite. Location is perfect. Great vibe from the hotel employees. Everyone is so friendly. Rooms are always nice and clean. You can tell the difference staying at the ROW!,6/21/18,5
This is THE place to stay in the theater district. Everything is walk able. The staff couldn't be more helpful and accommodating. And I can't speak highly enough about the morning breakfast crew. I can't wait to return just to say hi to them and have a continental breakfast. If you go to NYC for theater like I do make sure to get on their mailing list for special & say hello to the breakfast crew for me,6/21/18,4
The Row is everything you need it to be. All staff are pleasant and helpful. Check-in/out is a breeze. Rooms are quiet and clean. It is located such that you have easy access to attractions. I will be staying here again,6/21/18,5
"This hotel is not a 4 star, it needs maintenance done on the rooms they are outdated and not clean. A revamp is necessary, and it was not clean. Hair was left in the bathroom and the wall had tiles missing exposing the inner wall. The pillows were stained. ",6/21/18,2
"Props to Yanelly, who put me in a lovely room where i had a pleasant night, great Wi-Fi, and her best suggestions for getting to the subway. There is a starbucks less than a block away and they encouraged me to go there, and in short, made it a drama-free experience. Appreciate it! And the price was good as wel ",6/21/18,4
"Good hotel, close to Times Square. Friendly staff helped out when we had an issue at check in. Rooms a bit small but still ok. We did upgrade room but due to issue & check in (no room showing for us) we only got a standard room. Stylish & modern hotel. Close to bar's & restaurants. ",6/21/18,4
"Great location, very clean and cozy hotel. The design, style and decoration are very nice and modern. Staff and security are good. Parking is a bit far though. Slept and relaxed well. Amenities are awesome, and complete. Highly recommended ",6/21/18,4
"Front desk think they’re celebrities, fake nails and look down in weary travelers-parking is not included no matter what they tell you while booking. Two nights = $170 for valet. Only Bellman were down to earth ",6/20/18,2
"I thought it was great however the towel rack in the bathroom was broken and there was trash on the window sill in the bathroom when we checked in. Location was excellent but lines to check in were insane but once we got to the desk, staff was nic ",6/20/18,4
Cleanliness is a major issue.. no security to keep the drug dealers away from the front door.. or the aggressive panhandlers. Our room had hair and boogers on the bed+pillow. The floors were just gross.,6/20/18,1
"By far the best thing about this hotel is it’s location. We picked it based on a friend’s recommendation which was clear-eyed and concise so we knew what to expect. It’s not a top hotel although it’s not cheap but then what is in New York City? It’s a block from Times Square with all that goes with that, a block from the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the A, C and E subway lines are practically at the front door. Each of these were important considerations for us. This was my second time to visit so I booked a larger room than the cereal box I stayed in last time which was worth the few extra dollars. The room was large enough although ‘spacious’ would be a considerable over-statement. We had a view of 8th Avenue which is not the best vista in NYC but then what do you expect to see from a NY hotel (The hanging gardens of Babylon perhaps?). The room and bathroom were spotless, the elevators were very efficient unlike a lot of ‘better’ hotels I could mention. The front of house staff were somewhat brusque but, again, it’s New York so whatchagonnado? As a place to hang your hat for a couple of days it’ll do. Only real negative was the $30 a night ‘facility’ fee which was, to coin a phrase, a rip-off but this was pointed out to me when I booked so I can’t really complain. ",6/20/18,4
"What was advertised, I didn’t receive! My internet connection kept cutting off! I was hit with a number of hidden fees! Horrible experience! Staff were gracious but the package was falsely advertised! For that reason I would not come back ! ",6/20/18,1
A lovely hotel with excellent staff and amazing customer service in a good location. We were made to feel very welcome upon arrival and check-in was really quick and prompt. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay near Times Square. It is also close to the Metro and Bus Station and Theatre District. Lovely bar with friendly staff.,6/20/18,5
"This hotel is in a great position. Very central too many Time Square type activities. The rooms are so small that two people cannot walk past each other. But yes, they were very clean. The price advertised was a joke. It shows up around $99 on the internet, but the taxes, really, the (fees more than anything), generated a bill of over $150+ plus day. The gentleman handling the bags and answering questions near the front entrance were very nice and informative. Worse thing is the wait in line was too long. Not based just on the customer waiting, but the fact that they had only 3 people behind the counter, when at least 6 would have worked. Plus, the ones behind the counter was rather cold, in their responses. Didn't like them ",6/20/18,2
"we paid a blunder for a horrendous room, it had to be 4 star but a hostel would have had better rooms. we were very disappointed and will never return to this structure again, we feel cheated.I hope you can improve because the next customers are more satisfied ",6/20/18,2
Change the bedsheet and vacuum the floor properly! Can consider to paint the wall and do some renovation! Staff can be more polite And helpful! Please help to carry luggages for hotel guests from check in to check out. Luggage storage should be at the concierge and not at the back of some alley. More staff at the front desk as when we try to call no one is picking up.,6/19/18,1
"Superb location which is why we have stayed here several times. This time was probably our last. Check in was a nightmare, given a room on 3rd floor down a dark smelly hallway. WIndows were so filthy you couldn't see out of them. Lobby was always packed with people (I don't know if tours gather here?). Different management??? ",6/19/18,3
Great place to stay. Excellent location. Steps from Broadway - walk to Central Park. Food court inside hotel had great options. Great place to meet for drinks. Easy walk to shopping and other food options.,6/19/18,5
"Hotel is SUPER busy most of the day, crowded lobby, which is up on 2nd floor, rooms are extremely small. You can check in and out via the web, which is convenient, but there is also a ""resort"" fee, so when you add this to their low prices, it becoems more expensivcve than a same location, better or higher grade hotel ",6/19/18,3
"This has become my favorite place to stay when we travel to the city. The cost, room size, staff and location are the best I have experienced in my many trips. We typically come in for a weekend and have always been able to get a room here, which is the largest room for the price of any other hotel I have used in the city ",6/19/18,5
"I stayed there with my daughter at the end of May 2018. Overall the hotel was good enough, but there is room for improvement. Very convenient location, just off Times Square. Reception staff were efficient, but not welcoming nor friendly - we spoke to 3 different reception staff during our five day stay, and not one of them gave us a glimpse of a smile! In contrast, the Bar staff were absolutely great, very friendly, fun and attentive with service. We could not fault them. Our room was small, but that didn't bother us, as we spent most of the time out and about. It could have been cleaner - dust on the bedside table and lamp and the carpet has seen better days. Bathroom and shower were OK. The air con from adjacent rooms was noisy - we didn't have ours on at night-time, but could hear the other rooms' units quite loudly in our room, but we soon got used to the hum and it didn't bother us. We were bothered a couple of times by noisy teenagers in the corridors, who I assume were on a school trip. I had to speak to them on two occasions and received an apology from the adult who was supervising them - can't blame the hotel for that, but perhaps they could improve the room doors to keep out some of the noise. No noise at all from the city outside. The bar area is very trendy and pleasant, with music and a large video screen. Bar staff were excellent. The concierge were very helpful and friendly. Be aware of the additional local hotel charge when you check out. Overall the hotel was good and met our requirements ",6/19/18,3
Experience to remember. A drop in the bucket list. Enjoyable times and so close to time square. The beds are super comfortable. The noise level is next to none. Easy check in and check out process. Staff is amazing.,6/19/18,5
Small room with very loud air conditioner. The room was not very clean wich was a disappointment. The hotel style was trendy and pretty lound and automated. I personally prefer personal service and help at the concierce desk but here it was all self check in at machines.,6/18/18,3
Great over all customer service. from the time I checked in to the time checked out customer service over all was exceptional. I highly recommend Row Hotel NYC to everyone. Every time I need two come to NYC I always think of Row Hotel first,6/18/18,5
"For a last minute booking, the hotel was good but not great. It is really a bedroom to change, shower and sleep. The hotel is situated within walking distances of most places - a little pricey for the room but clean and neat and helpfu ",6/18/18,4
"Really nice hotel, and in a great location, just two block to times square. Rooms are on the small side, but very clean. The staff are all wonderful. The city kitchen was very good, it had nice options for breakfast and lunch. Would recommend this hotel ",6/18/18,4
"I have said I enjoyed my stay at Row, I am retired Navy Veteran and it was my first time back to NY in many years, I saw and did many of the things I used too do while stationed at the Brooklyn Navy Yar ",6/18/18,5
"The bed sheets had stains. ,rooms are super old. There was an iron burn/stain in the carpet and it felt dirty. The towels looked dingy and dirty. I was so glad it was only one night. I got a price on the Internet-due to my schedule I had to check out online -the cost was not the Internet price. I felt very disappointed. ",6/18/18,1
"the bed was the worst, the room is too little, too much noise in the halls, air conditioner is too noisy too, space in the bathroom so uncomfortable,,,,, I'll not recommend this hotel in the future, next year I'll go to another on ",6/18/18,3
Every thing went wonderful at our stay at the Row. Check in was great and easy. In fact they upgraded our room at no charge. We have never stayed at a place that every thing went fine. We will be back. By the way. The elevators worked fine. Very quick and efficient,6/18/18,4
You might as well get another hotel that is $30 a night more since they'lll spring that required fee on you when you arrive. Housekeeping is impossible to reach and they didn't show up our 2nd day. Found a dead bug in the bed. I was expecting a small room but it was so tiny there wasn't even room for luggage. You could only take 1 step in the bathroom. There wasn't a vent and would get really hot unless we left the door open. The elevators we used in the hotel smelled bad and were tiny,6/18/18,1
"No shower curtain. dust everywhere. Room was dirty and bathroom smelled like urine. Would not recommend this, very disappointed and was charged an extra $100 and was deceived about the final price... ",6/18/18,1
"Clean, and easily accessible to TSQ. A bit pricey for the size and quality of the room. I'll shop around a little more next time to get something better for the value. If the room had been as impressive as the rest of the property it would be great ",6/18/18,3
The row is a really great place to spend the night it's quite and within walking distance to times square. Would stay again. The room was really small but all its for is sleeping and having a place that s close to everythin,6/18/18,5
"The standard rooms are small but very nice and clean. Staff are extremely friendly and happy to help. Hotel food & bar is reasonably and tasty I would definitely stay here again because the location is fantastic to time square, Empire State Building, Broadway & bus stop ",6/18/18,5
"Comfy beds, clean with a decent gym. Water and ice machines on each floor. Ideal place to stay whilst in the city for business, providing you don’t mind the busy midtown area. I’d recommend for short trips ",6/18/18,3
"The location is near from everywhere and hotel people is super kind. They let me check in early even with room upgrade. If I have chance to visit NY again, I'll absolutely stay in Row NYC again. Perfect ",6/17/18,5
"The hotel is very clean, fun, young and vibrant. Booked a “city view” but it was a very very partial city view was disappointed in that but the rest of the experience was wonderful. Had a free breakfast with our room which was pasteries, Juice and a piece of fruit. It was free so whatever, right? The location can’t be beat for the price. We were seeing Phantom of the Opera and little to my knowledge is on the same street!! I informed them of the special occasion ahead of time (Wedding Anniversay, Birthday and my husband is Active Duty Military) so I sort of thought they would do SOMETHING in the room. Alas, nothing extra but that’s okay. Not expected but would have been a special addition. ",6/17/18,5
"First and foremost it is important to note that we are hotel owners ourselves in Asia and may look at things a little differently.We booked this hotel due to the location and our neglect to stay at international brands. We thought the images online we nice and did not further check any reviews.As we arrived we were lucky enough to get directly to the desk where we were helped by a friendly receptionist. However it took him a good 15min to get our keys although we arrived at 9pm. Apparently they have over 1000 rooms but only a few receptionists. Once we had our keys we went straight to our rooms to sleep as we had a long journey. The next day we realized where we were and unfortunately our room was full of hair. On walls, bathroom curtain on the air-conditioner, etc. As we booked through the corporate director of Sales and had the General Manager's email address, we sent an email of our dissappointment. The same evening we received a response saying 'your room has been serviced' without any apology or such from the GM. Unfortunately however all the hairs were still there although we sent images to the GM. This clearly shows very little effort or care of guests' comfort.It's a very strange hotel concept with self service everywhere and the product is rather worn-out and bad maintenance.I little more leadership on the top would probably help to motivate employees and assure higher guet quality but then again if the hotel is filled at this location with rates at over 200$ a night and they still need more rooms, then why additional effort? For us it was a let down because our concerns were neglected completely ",6/17/18,2
Good hotel. Well situated and very close to times square. Water and ice stations on various floors. Very handy as it helped to reduce the cost of buying water. Attached to the Sugar Factory and being a guest also got you a discount in other place,6/17/18,4
"We had a Deluxe window view BUT the room was literally 10x10! The bathroom was even smaller......you can shower, use the toilet and brush your teeth in the sink at the same time. The room was clean and location was good for all the Broadway Shows. The bathtubs liner was broken and a pool of water formed under it causing ""a waterbed "" effect in the shower! Although, for almost $300 a night....definitely not worth it ",6/17/18,3
It is an ideal offer if you just like to sleep clean and comfortable for a fair price. And with Time Square just around the corner you can’t imagine a better hotel. We especially loved the vieuw to wake up with and fall asleep with.,6/17/18,5
Great hotel and conveniently placed. The staff were amazing! Very friendly and very helpful. The hotel was clean and conveniently located in the heart of New York City. Our room was spacious and comfortable,6/16/18,5
"We had 3 Rooms, 2 x 2 double bed rooms and 1 x double room. On arrival one of the rooms wasn’t clean, bad smell in bathroom and stained bed clothes but we were moved immediately. The others rooms were clean. All rooms were small but well equipped. The hotel bar and the attached city kitchen provided lots of choice for food if you didn’t want to explore, however the great location meant you had loads of choice all around you. I would stay at this hotel again ",6/16/18,4
I have stayed here a number of times. The rooms are small but the beds are comfortable. Checkin is always chaotic and slower than I like. They make it difficult to change payment arrangements on arrival but you absolutely cannot beat the location.,6/16/18,4
"The Row is in the ultimate location. We were able to walk around the corner to all the Broadway shows and the subway was steps away. The room was comfortable and quiet. Although the room was old and small, the staff made our stay very pleasant. ",6/16/18,4
"Room was fine and clean. It was big enough for three of us, but could have used a small coffee/tea maker with cups. Very convenient to shows and restaurants! Only real problem occurred before we even arrived and was incredibly mishandled by Row. I made this reservation through Booking.com. “Row” sent me a completely unsolicited email offer that if I shared the info about my stay on social media, they would give me vouchers for two drinks at their hotel for each single post on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. I posted on all three and should have received a total of six drink vouchers. Having not received the email vouchers they promised in their offer, I emailed Row for an update. Here’s their response: “Unfortunately, since this reservation was made through a third party, this reservation would not qualify for this offer. It is only valid for bookings made directly on our website. ”(1) So why did Row send me the offer? (2) They still received the benefit of the free advertising on three social media platforms that they were seeking in their unsolicited offer and request to me, yet they refused to honor their offer to me.(3) How can a NYC significant hotel located in the Theatre District be so cheap so as not to honor an unsolicited offer they made and through which they received the benefit of free advertising on three social media platforms? (4) How can Row be so stupid as not to realize that this would backfire on them completely and now lead to incredible NEGATIVE advertising about them and their shady business practices? I was forced to update my free Row advertising posts on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. This will also be a part of my reviews here on Trip Advisor, Booking. com, and Expedia.(5) If this keeps ONE customer from reserving a room from Row in the future they will have lost a comparatively large amount contrasted with the cost of some drinks for their “guests” ",6/16/18,4
"Only disappointing thing about this trip to NY was the hotel. Charge facility fees for facilities that didn’t work and when asked for them to be repaired, almost laughed at!! The room small, bath didn’t drain, no light bulbs in any lamps, sliding door in bathroom nearly dislocated my shoulder... do I need to go on!!! This hotel is all about the €€€ it makes if it’s clients NOT the customers that spend time there!! ",6/16/18,1
"Great place to stay central for everything, rooms quite small but really clean comfy bed and everything you need hairdryer safe etc , staff very helpful and friendly, most attractions are within walking distance subway is on nearly every corner , first time in New York but certainly not the last  ",6/16/18,4
"Perfect location with lots of “southern hospitality” from staff. One “city” block here or there to great food, shopping and broadway shows. 1/3 of price of the hotel a block away we stayed earlier. Will definitely book again in future ",6/16/18,4
"this hotel is a good value, but there $36 daily resort fee is deceptive--they are NOT a resort. Just charge the price you need to charge and be up front about it! this one act irritates me every time i check in here ",6/16/18,4
"This hotel is PERFECT for us gals!! It’s safe, comfortable, & close to all activities.. especially the subway, Times Square & 5th Avenue!! Will stay here again. Only wish they would have a mini coffee make ",6/16/18,5
"Great location, close to everything. Cleaning staff extremely friendly and helpful. Gentlemen that checked us in (I think his name was Ceaser, Brazilian) was extremely friendly and helped making us more comfortable. ",6/15/18,4
"this hotel, is located very close to the theater where the Phantom of the Opera is presented, if you want to live the experience of staying in the heart of Manhattan this is a good option, just go out and you are surrounded by the vibe of times square, a place that makes you fall in love and leaves you the best memories of that beautiful cit ",6/15/18,4
Bathrooms are so tiny and impossible for a plus sized person to maneuver much less fit on the toilet because it is wedged between a wall and the sink! I asked for a different room with a larger bathroom but they couldn’t accommodate me until the next day. Really? I guess I won’t use the restroom for over 24 hours sure no problem!,6/15/18,2
"Close to everything, 1 block from Times Square and Broadway, 15 minute walk to Central Park. Couldn’t ask for a better location. I’d definitely stay here if I travel to New York again. Rooms were comfortable. ",6/15/18,4
Love love love the location! The city kitchen is very convenient and high-quality! The elevator system works well. First time I’ve been able to check in online and love that feature also. My 14 stay at The Row NyC and I will be back,6/15/18,5
"We loved our stay, to be honest it was better than I expected. The staff were friendly, the lady who cleaned our room was so kind, she always checked in on us, the bartenders were also patient and attentive. Would stay again on my next trip. ",6/15/18,5
"Good, clean room. a little on the small side. Had a bit of trouble with the a/c. But it was taken care of. Can't beat the location. Most of the theaters are right around the corner. I would stay there again ",6/15/18,5
The Row hotel is a great hotel to stay in. It offers everything. If you like a drink at night time there is a bar there or if you want to work out there is a gym. It’s suitable for everyone. The location is perfect close to all Amenitie,6/15/18,5
"Stayed here for five nights, 9th - 14th June. Was worried after reading some of the reviews but needn’t of been as it turned out to be the best decision to stay here. Checking in was easy, met the renowned Ceaser, who checked us in no problem. Went to the lifts and had no problem seeing how they worked (see photos), explanation on key pads are easy to understand. Good security by the lifts as you had to show your key card to be able to use the lifts. Room was very spacious. Towels and bed cleaned and made up every day. Air conditioning was good. We were on the 3rd floor and by the second night the noise didn’t disturb us at all (and we live in the country where there it is totally silent at night, except for owls!). I think the amount of walking we were doing helped us to sleep! We found the drinks and food prices in the hotel to be no different to anywhere else in the city. We had found a good couple of dive bars to get cheaper evening drinks (Jimmy’s Corner and Rudy’s). Had a small problem with the safe in our room, rang guest services (who answered straight away) and the security man was with us within 10 minutes to fix it. All in all the Row NYC was a fantastic choice of hotel and I would recommend it to everyone, and would definately have no hesitation staying there again. ",6/15/18,3
"Loved staying here. So easy. Right close to Time's Square. Clean. Modern. Compact. Great Value. Close to the subway right downtown in Hell's Kitchen. Fantastic rooms and beds. Airconditioning. The room was a little tight, but how much time do you spend in your hotel room ",6/15/18,5
"Mold on wallpaper in bathroom, lightswitches were filthy. Great -actually PERFECT- location for Broadway shows, great bar, and we loved the kiosk that let us make our own keys. There is no mini-bar, so bring your own snacks. ",6/15/18,3
Great location and vibe! Our room was not big but it was clean and the bed was comfortable. We were on the 9th floor but never had to wait for an elevator. We would recommend this hotel to friends and family,6/15/18,4
"Easy and perfect location - short walk (10-15 min) to PENN and MSG, Good food and the desk was great with subway help and questions. Will stay again and nice that you have food on site now, would have Loved to have a bloody Mary at Bar in the am but was told no alcohol until 2pm? oh well .... ",6/15/18,4
Everything was as described. This was our second stay... obviously we would not have returned if we weren't satisfied the first time. The express and email check in check out is convenient as the desk line is lengthy even though there are adequate guest relations personnel. You absolutely cannot beat the location and onsite amenities,6/14/18,5
Great location. Great price for NYC. It's a hip hotel and it is clean. Good service when you need it. I've stayed here on numerous occasions. Zen Kitchen is convenient for good food - since you're in the middle of Time Square it can be difficult finding non-tourist food,6/14/18,5
"I very rarely take the time to write reviews, but the staff at ROW deserve the effort in return for their good service. All staff were wonderful, but I want to make special mention of the group of gentlemen working in the luggage storage area and Junior at check-in. The gentleman storing our luggage were friendly, professional, and made drop-off quick and easy. Thank you! As for Junior, I will say that there are many people who do their job well, and he certainly does his job professionally. But some individuals in customer service positions seem to find a greater purpose to their work, in terms of being helpful and making a human connection with their customers. Such individuals understand what it means to be hospitable and make guests feel welcome. I would say that Junior is one of those special, stand-out people. Thank you, Junior, for being so pleasant and going above and beyond. As for the hotel, it is a great place to stay, especially for the price. I have stayed places with fancier room furnishings, but if you are there to take in an awesome city like NYC, I am not sure why anyone would plan to spend much time in a hotel room or waste money on stuffy wing back chairs, etc. ROW has a young, minimalist, contemporary style, that brings to mind IKEA... emphasis on functional, with a cool vibe. The teens/young adults I was traveling with loved it! Everything was perfectly clean and tidy in our room. I felt safe, and there were no noise issues where we stayed on the 17th floor. Above all, the location was FABULOUS! We saw Phantom and Frozen, and they were literally just around the block, steps away. Overall, great hotel, awesome location, superb staff! So don’t hesitate to go with ROW ",6/14/18,5
"Birthday trip for my son and I . Slight problem with our room not ready on arrival but Ceaser was great and waived the service fee. Excellent location, room was small but as expected with everything working ie Air con and all very clean . Beds comfortable. Was concerned prior to our trip with some of the online reviews but we needn’t have worried . Would definitely stay here again ",6/14/18,4
"Housekeeping was excellent. The room is very small and bathroom is cramped. Hotel extremely busy which caused some waiting for elevators. Overall good experience. Breakfast was very good for the cost with fresh fruits, juices and pastries ",6/13/18,3
"The Good:This hotel is located at the corner of 8th Avenue and W 44th Street. Which means that it is literally just a two block walk from the beginning of Times Square. So you can get there quickly to see what is going on day and night.You can walk easily to it from the Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Station and other nearby places. Coming out of the hotel, just turn right and go 13 blocks along 8th Avenue and it will bring you to Columbus Circle at the edge of central park. The gentlemen who store your bags on the lower level were nice, informative about local places and such.You can easily walk down to the Intrepid Carrier from this hotel. There are several good food shops in the area, like the Shake Shack and my favorite, Time Square Diner & Cafe (good food, not cheap though). The Bad:Unfortunately, the front desk staff had absolutely no personality. They were just cool and functional. Since I'm coming from the South, I guess, they were just typical New Yorkers, but I didn't like the connection.The rooms are so tiny! Yes, very tiny. I went up with a friend and we could not pass by each other in any part of that room. One person had to move while the other one sat. The carpeting needs to be replaced. It left a dark spot on your socks anytime you walked on it, so I walked around in my sneakers the whole time, except when in the bathroom. Beds, well, just one word, TINY! Super comfortable, no, but after a days worth of walking NY, they felt fine. Bathroom, TINY! However, everything in the room was clean and functional, except that carpet. So no complaints there. -Check-in was horrible, they didn't have enough desk agents for the crowd that was there when we got there about 11am. They had something jokingly called 'pre-check-in', where you just basically let them know you are here and you send your bags downstairs. Elevators were fast. We were on the 22nd floor and you didn't have to wait long for one going up and down.The lobby is loud with a restaurant or bar adjacent to it. Lastly, don't fall for the pricing you see for this hotel or any other hotel in NY for that matter. This hotel like many hotels these days, show artificially low prices on the search websites. For example, I'm looking at it now for $99 now, sounds good, right? By the time they throw in other profit making fees (in Vegas they call the 'resort fees'), that $99 becomes about $158 (approximately by bill) for the night! NOTE: That is not unique to this hotel. Lots of hotels do it, trying to entice the price conscious shopper, knowing by the time you complete the booking process, you just CLICK it, so you don't have to start over. Okay place to stay, yes! Location is really good. Expect luxury stay on that $158? No! Hey, this is New York, remember! But I stayed at the Millenium Broadway,real luxury and paid less than $180. --- ",6/13/18,3
"A small and noisy room. 2145. There are a lot of waiting for the elevators. The best thing about the hotel is the location of it. In the lobby hotel there were cockroaches , I killed one myself. Hotel staff in general were pleasant and attentive ",6/13/18,2
"The location, staff friendliness, overall quality of the place & room were good. My only issue was the room choice. Paid for a superior, got a regular. Internet could also use improvements. Would still recommend though. ",6/12/18,4
"Overall the rooms are tiny, and there are lots of challenges with the property. Malfunctioning elevators are a key one. Tiny rooms are another. Difficult Front Desk staff was a total negative experience to start of my stay, after a 30 minute wait. Ice machines did not work, except one, and had to go down to 1 to get back to my room. While the property was very busy, it is apparent that it is not a service driven property. It's more like cattle car lodging. Recommend you stay elsewhere. The Intercontinental is half a block away, and is excellent ",6/12/18,2
"Overall, we enjoyed our stay. All the staff we spoke to were nice and helpful. Our room was small but met our needs. Row NYC is an affordable option in a great location. We will come back again in the future. ",6/12/18,4
"I only stayed one night, but I had a very comfortable king size bed in a nice size corner room with awesome views of the sunset over the Hudson River and 8th Ave. The front desk staff were very helpful and polite ",6/12/18,5
"It was my first stay at ROW NYC, it was for business and I'll be back. I had a nice room with a city view and it didn't feel too small. I will make sure I get a room with a window and a view. The staff was friendly and I'll be back for non work related travel ",6/12/18,4
"Overall hotel is nice. The hotel in general is Very loud everywhere in the hotel. Wish there was a quite bar area to sit and talk. Rooms are VERY tiny. The fire alarm went off while we were there but could not understand the person over the loud speaker. Very poor/broken English. We thought he said testing, but I guess their was a small fire. ",6/12/18,4
"Pretty Good, only problem was the toile is in between a wall and the bathtub, i didnt not fit in it. I had to put my let in the bathtub in prder to be able to use it, everythong else was good, location is grea ",6/12/18,4
I think that charging handeling fee of 11$ (not o1 not 2 and not 5) per every box delivered to your hotel is best describes the type of the hotel because it does not have any other thing in its favore when comparing to its peers (no mini bar ' nothing). worst hotel i visited in manhattan.the only good thing i can say about this hotel is its WIFI in room/,6/12/18,1
"Check in was easy but impersonal, check in online and make your own keys. All without talking to anyone. The 1st interaction with anyone was a security guard at the elevator who promptly sent me up the wrong elevator. The elevators were confusing and smelly. Once I figure them out it still was annoying. The rooms were tiny and the floors had a lot of debris left everyday. The bathrooms were super cramped. All said and done this hotel had the best location, unfortunately it was cold and uninviting. Rooms need a mini fridge ",6/11/18,3
"I found the location very walkable to all theaters, Times Square, 42nd Street, nearby restaurants and Port Authority. Check in was easy online and staff was all very personable. Lobby was always noisy and full of folks, seems very popular hotel for high school groups. ",6/11/18,4
"Over all very good, specially employee attentiveness and clean room. Also the security at the front of elevators was welcome since I was traveling alone. Centrally located, near Times Square, restaurants, theaters and transportation to other attractions like museums. A little bit concerned with hall lighting, found them somewhat dark ",6/11/18,4
"Decent hotel very close to all the action. They upgraded our room which was nice, amenities were a bit pricey. Hotel lobby decor was beautiful but room furniture looked a bit worn at least in our room. ",6/11/18,4
"This hotel was perfect for our needs, it is a ten minute walk to Times Square and very clean. The only thing I would suggest is a coffee maker in the rooms and a fridge otherwise everything else was perfect! I recommend going to the bar district M, the bartender Jarrett was so friendly, attentive and outgoing and really made us feel welcomed. We even got to meet the manager Mauricio who was very gracious and welcoming! I recommend this hotel for close proximity to Times Square and good prices ",6/11/18,5
"Good Hotel near Times Square but behind it, therefore you won't have trouble getting to it. Hotel staff are excelled especially Mr. Junior who helped us getting our room and settled in. Ok-sized rooms in comparison to other hotels who have much smaller rooms for a higher cost. This is my third time here ",6/11/18,4
"First impressions were good, clean, nice lobby area, friendly and helpful staff (working for tips obviously!) but after checking in and opening our door to the room we were very disappointed. The floor space of the room wasn't even big enough to open our cases on the floor, it was a very tight squeeze. We went to reception who offered us an upgrade, at a cost, although it was a discounted cost, the upgraded room was better but not fantastic.I feel the rooms have a lot of foot traffic being a central hotel, the walls needed painting and the bathroom redecorating, the room just wasn't looked after. The bar/food outlet was very good though, expensive but nice portions and fresh food.Be careful of the added extra costs, when we booked we didn't see we had to pay a daily charge for Wi-Fi, bottled water, printing and some other small services. If flying into JFK I would highly recommend getting the subway directly to 42nd Port Authority / Bus Terminal, it take around the same time as a taxi and only costs around $15 per person, the hotel is then only a 2-3 minute walk from the subway station. Overall it is a great hotel for location, 5 minutes walk and you are in Times Square or Hell's Kitchen, 10 minutes Central Park and very close to numerous subway stations. Would return because the location beats the negatives ",6/11/18,4
The rooms were too small and the path while going to the room is very creepy. I look the city view room and the view was not all good. Not worth for the money spent. The only good thing about this hotel is the location its close to everything around times square,6/10/18,3
A good hotel close to Times Square. You can tell it’s been re vamped as some bits look painted over yet still a bit tatty. Don’t let this out you off though as it was a great place to set up base for a few days in NY. The rooms are very small but functional. The lobby is great with entertainment on some evenings in the bar. I would definitely return and would recommend to others,6/10/18,4
"I made reservations 2 months in advance. We arrived to the hotel at 2am Memorial Day weekend, because our flight was delayed. Since we arrived after check in they sold our room. They didn’t have any rooms for the night. They pretty much just kicked us out. We had nowhere to go! My husband and I started calling every hotel until we finally found one. This was just terrible! I wish this hotel would have called me or something to ask about my reservations. ",6/10/18,1
"Our bus tour arranged for us to stay at the Row. A great location, clean room though small but not by New York standards. We didn't eat or drink there so cannot comment. I did have a coffee one morning but it was cold. The staff was courteous - I had to use the bathroom after checking out but had no issues having the courtesy desk person give me a pass card. It is abit dated but that did not matter to us. There is a safe in the room. Wheelchair accessible. ",6/9/18,3
I have booked this trip via Expedia. I opted for paying at the hotel- wish I didn’t as they overcharged me by £100. Also room I was given was right next to elevators. So every time anyone was coming back from night out I was woken up by the noise. Also when people punched numbers in for lift- it was noisy in the room. The room was very dusty. I don’t think they should bother with advertising that they offer internet- as it never worked whilst I was there. I have stayed at older hotels in NYC before that were better managed. Would never consider Row again.,6/9/18,1
We were very happy with the Row NYC. The hotel was very a short walk to Times Square. Our room was on a high floor with a view of the street. The room was small but comfortable. We had breakfast included and we enjoyed a choice of 4 places to have it,6/8/18,4
I travel to NYC a lot and am not one to have negative things to say but this experience was so terrible. From the moment we checked in the woman looked like she was completely stoned and couldn't put a sentence together. No eye contact and literally just flat out rude. I know that NY is notorious for small rooms but this was beyond small. The bathroom was so small that a small garbage can was placed in the centre which really took up the whole floor. I didn't find the beds comfortable and the hallways were extremely noisy. Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere els,6/8/18,1
"Location was amazing, simple check in (It can get a bit busy at certain times of the day), and check out was easy using the express checkout system. The Lobby can be very noisy and busy, once your on your floor the noise dissipates :) ",6/8/18,5
GORGEOUS hotel and so close to everything - the location was perfect. The rooms were gorgeous and the staff were so helpful. We got to keep our room key when checking out as a souvenir. We didn't eat int he hotel but the food looked yummy,6/7/18,5
Little pricey. Close to everything. The tub was a little strange felt like I was on a water bed. Little different kind of room it had a big sign on the wall saying Open 24 Hours. But I guess you want to stap in hip hotel than stay at the ROW.,6/7/18,3
"Upon check in, we were requested to wait a few moments since they had yet to prepare our room. As it was already 5 pm, I told the staff that I was surprised that our room is not prepared and ready for us. Apologetically, the staff said that she would upgrade us to a bigger room. Indeed, it was. So glad we had a huge, comfortable bedroom with equally huge bathroom and a great city view. We stayed for 5 nights and it was marvellous. One thing though, the elevators had foul smell at times. ",6/7/18,5
"Our firm's travel agent booked me into this hotel. Upon my arrival I had the sense of a BUZZ of people - lots of young [ 13 - 16 yr. olds to millennials], flight attendants, etc. The hotel is located almost in Times Sq. so if location is your most important thing then this is a good spot. For me, the hotel is old and even though a renovation was done, the sense was that it was overly lived in. The furniture, laminate, was peeling and the lighting was harsh. The air conditioner is on the celling and vented directly at the bed. All in all - I knew within a few minutes of walking the room that I would't be comfortable there. It looked overly lived in and the HVAC system would keep me up at night - I called down and asked for the manager. I explained to him I wouldn't be comfortable in that room and I needed to be released from my reservation. They were accommodating and let me cancel on the moment without a fee, which i appreciated. One doesn't like to feel as if you're going to have to have a confrontation. I am a traveler who enjoys a higher end experience and a more sophisticated design. I'm sure this is good for those who don't care about where they sleep as long as they're in NYC. The lobby was funky, and there was obviously some consideration to making the hallways funky too - and the rooms a feeling of being boutique-ie. Having stayed at much nicer hotels I wouldn't return to this hotel. I'm just not their target audience and that is ok. Oh, and it didn't help I was told i was being ""upgraded"" - but my view was of an alley ",6/7/18,3
Room was just right for us. Not big but we only used it to sleep. Hotel is close to everything. Caesar at the desk was especially helpful and courteous. The only problem was that for some reason we were unable to make calls to Canad,6/7/18,4
"Small room and bathroom, the beautiful pictures at the site do not reflect the real rooms. In prticular the barhroom is too small. Wifi is sometimes slow. But rooms were clean, friendly personell. It was not possible to book breakfast via booking.co ",6/7/18,3
I just checked in a few minutes ago and my room literally smells like a garbage can. It’s so bad. And it’s really beat up in a whole bunch of different ways. See the pictures. I went into the bathroom and there was literally like a handful of public hair on the sink. I’m not joking. It’s so dirty and smells bad and I’m stuck here for two days. Very disappointing to take my daughter on a big trip to New York and see her face the moment we walked in. It’s filthy,6/7/18,1
"the hotel should charge separately for use of the wifi in the room for use of the gym, instead of charging a one-time resort fee for both services, including for those who do not use the gym; or else already include the service in the amount of the daily, as it confuses the consumer who pays a higher price at the en ",6/7/18,4
Daily cleans service was not professional. (Sometime bed making wasnt done) wifi connection was weak and unstable in the room. Great location but I won’t choose Times Square area next time as it’s super busy area. stressful to walk between subway to hote,6/7/18,3
"Clean and quiet. My family and I had a great stay at this iconic hotel. The room was small, but given the location, it was perfect for my business purposes and provided easy access to attractions and transportation. We'll be back ",6/7/18,4
"Hotel is in a prime location near Times Square, but the rooms aren't cleaned well, and the bathrooms are very small. Rooms aren't well maintained, and furnishings are quite damaged. Lifts take a very long time to arrive as well ",6/7/18,2
I was visiting NYC with my 13 year old daughter and could not have asked for a warmer check-in by the wonderful and friendly Cesar who surprised us with a room upgrade. My daughter was thrilled to suddenly a bed to herself. We loved the comfortable room and awesome location. Not to mention the great view we had of Broadway from our window. The staff were all so friendly and always willing to help. It was our first time at Row but definitely not our last. The stay really made our mother-daughter vacation special,6/7/18,5
"The staff at the Row NYC are more than accommodating and wonderful. They were so pleasant and kind, they made check in and check out so quick and easy! Location is 10/10, not too loud but close to everything. Keep in mind this is clearly not a 5 star resort, but if you’re in NYC you shouldn’t be spending too much time in the room anyway! The room I found to be spacious for the city, and very clean. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom had decent lighting. I would absolutely stay here again. There are many places to eat around the area, close to theaters and Times Square. I couldn’t have asked for a better stay, thanks Row NYC! Would definitely stay here again ",6/7/18,5
While the location is goodThe room sizes are terrible. Even the queen double room meant for occupancy of 4 was terribleThe size of the bath is abysmal . While the charges are comparable to the other hotels in the area the rooms are disappointing,6/6/18,3
"The location couldn't be better for Broadway and nightlife. There are many restaurants and specialty shops within a short walking distance. The staff are always friendly and professional, the rooms are a little small but are safe,clean, and comfortable. ",6/6/18,5
"We chose Row NYC as the hotel for our stay based on its location near the Broadway theaters we planned on frequenting. We were not disappointed on that point! The main purpose of our trip was to see Dear Evan Hansen at the Music Box theater, which was literally just around the corner. The hotel was also within easy walking distance of Times Square, the New York Public Library which houses Christopher Robin's original Pooh toys, and the Empire State Building, which were all other things we wanted to see while visiting NY. There were so many great places to eat in the area we never had to go farther than across the street or just down the block.The other positive attribute of this hotel is the people who work there. They were all extremely helpful and polite. We did the kiosk check in and check out (including making our own keys), so that was painless. They also held our bags for about 6 hours after we checked out for a very small fee.The negatives: Very little money has been spent on maintenance on this hotel. They have fancy elevators that you can call to take you to your room. But once we got to the room, we were aghast. The room was minuscule, barely with room to walk around the bed. We pulled back the bed cover and there were lumps underneath the sheet. I raised the sheet to try to smooth the mattress cover underneath, but it was so filthy I was afraid to touch it. The wood was falling apart at the base of the doors, and what painting had been done had been done over wood that was clearly falling apart with no sanding or finishing beforehand. It was like someone said, ""Paint it fast and cheap! We don't care about quality!"" Our shower faucet was dangling out of the wall. And the noise! I'm not talking about outside street noise, but the noise of the building. It sounded like someone was banging with a crowbar on the pipes in the ceiling and walls night and day. The first night there I woke up several times to the banging noises.If you're traveling on a budget and want a well-located hotel, this could be your choice. If you have a bigger budget, I would recommend you choose a different hotel ",6/6/18,2
"This was our second consecutive year to visit NYC and stay at the ROW. Our accommodations exceeded last year's as the room was pristine. The rooms aren't extravagant but they are comfortable and quiet. Most importantly, the staff display a welcoming culture that allays any anxieties the hubbub of the theatre district might provoke. We'll be back! ",6/6/18,4
"The ROW NYC is in a great location for Times Sq, and a number of other sites, and we have always been warmly welcomed in the past. This trip we see a huge decline in the level of service, when i brought to the teams attention an issue, i was advised it was my fault.The concierge service was of no help at all, i asked about booking services twice and on both ocasions they just told me to ",6/6/18,2
"A good choice for a budget hotel in NYC. Rooms are not too small..and the facility is old.But the service and the location more than make up for it.For the price, it's a good choice for NYC.The downstairs City Kitchen is a great bonus ",6/5/18,3
Amazing location and friendly staff. The rooms are a little tired but the beds are very comfortable! Would recommend the hotel because of its convenience - everything you need is available. A great base for a trip to New York,6/5/18,4
This is our go to hotel when we visit NYC. You will not be disappointed. Quite clean modern rooms. The elevators come quick with minimal wait time. Staff is friendly and helpful. Food is close to the hotel and resaonably price,6/5/18,5
Bed were small but comfortable everything was spotless and the location is amazing. However in the middle of the night while me and my friend were sleeping an employee opened our room door. Other than that it was a nice stay,6/5/18,5
"Stayed for a week. Value for money is good as the room was nice and the location is fabulous, very close to Times Square, hop on hop off buses, restaurant row etc. Staff are mostly friendly, we had a little trouble with the concierge not providing correct information on a few occasions but otherwise, a nice place to stay in NYC ",6/5/18,4
Great value for its location walking distances to many sought after locations and food. Great rooms but would’ve loved queen beds. Very modern feel and loved the ability to goneifr next door for breakfast with many amazing varieties of donuts! Also liked the hotel rate on parking that was offered right around the corner from the hotel,6/5/18,4
"Stayed for 5 nights, in this hotel. Great location, 20 mins in either direction and you hit a tourist spot or sightseeing bit. 2 blocks from Times Square, brilliant. Hotel though..is a bit dated in areasOur room wasnt spectacularly clean, even with maid service, (I don’t think they wiped the tables, dusted etc) sheets and towels were done and bathroom sink was cleaned but bath and maybe toilet weren’t. They did vacuum. The electrical point in the bathroom was wonky and it just seemed like the room needed updating, and this was a queen room, god help if it was a standard. Also a queen room, with a door that led next door which we didn’t ask for...However the room itself was ok, had a tv with loads of channels and the bed was comfy. But to be fair you’re in New York, you wouldn’t want to spend most of your time in your room. It was comfortable and okay, just not wow. Lobby was clean, they’ve got security for after 6pm, and WiFi is accessible everywhere in the hotel. Also have a bar and restaurant nearby, and staff member Junior, was helpful and polite when we checked in. Agree with other reviewers ideal for a few days, not good for longer than a wee ",6/5/18,3
I arrived at 5 am from a mid night flight. The online check in was a great comfort to know that my room was ready but on checking in... the personal touch of the front desk staff made the difference. During my stay I had quite a few questions and request. The front desk staff were always helpful and friendly. Even Olivia in housekeeping on the third floor was ultra helpful... if she didn't know she got her boss to ask the required department to assist. Due to this level of consistent professionalism ... when i had to extend my stay due to airline problem... I stayed right at the ROW NYC. Great job team..,6/5/18,4
"General Interior Design is at the top, lighting and atmosphere is on point. Best of all, the deliciouss smell and the fact that it fells fresh scented everytime I pass through the main entranceBeds are nice to sleep and shampoo and other bathroom supplies smells the same so you can relate sensations very well. Convinience store is small but has it all you need and the gentelman is a lovely and warm sr you can talk toYou fell secure as in order to get in to the elevator you need to show you room ke ",6/5/18,5
"The Row has been our hotel several times now as the location, just off Times Square, can't be beat. The smart elevators make for ease in getting around the hotel, even large -- and tall -- as it is. We appreciate being near Restaurant Row and especially Club Swing 46, a retro supper club with great swing music ",6/4/18,5
"Hotel is located in the middle of the Times Square . You can walk to everything . Unfit the building is old, rooms and tiny and even though staff is trying to keep them clean, they are old and I would say shady. If you are looking for a bed to stay in the grate touristy location, you got it. If you are looking for a more luxurious room, this is not the place. ",6/4/18,3
Initial impression is of large youth hostel but don’t be put off this hotel works so well for all ages. From check in to leaving worked like clockwork. Minimal staff contact required but always there if you need them. Online check in worked well and key pick up fast. Lifts worked well in even very busy times as you key in floor and you are allocated a lift. Rooms small but has everything you’d ever need. As with all central city hotels a deal of background traffic and city noise.. I’d ask for a high floor no. New York never sleeps. Perfect little cation a stones throw from Broadway and Times Square. Subway just across road. Several good restaurants nearby... nothing to fault.,6/4/18,5
"Is a nice hotel , location is excellent , staff was very helpful and friendly , bathroom nice and clean , room clean and bed very comfortable I will stay at this hotel again And can recommend to my friend ",6/4/18,4
"The bathroom is too small to comfortably sit on the toilet. The paint is peeling on the doors and trim. The price was good. Breakfast was one pastry, one piece of fruit, one juice, and coffee. I have to have 200 characters in my review so this last sentence is filler ",6/4/18,3
"Ideal & convenient location, not to mention affordable for the area too. Just a few minutes walk from Times Square's attractions, Bars, Restaurants and shopping galore. This hip, contemporary Hotels offers basic and essential amenities, which includes Free WiFi and a complimentary Internet Lounge. Check in/out was friendly and quick! Stayed in a Premium City View Room which are on the highest floors, decorated in red displaying ""REST""aurant and offered scenic views of Manhattan ",6/4/18,5
"Had a great time. Got early checkin (after some email adventures) room was small but clean, WiFi worked fine, location for seeing a play was ideal, City Kitchen was inside and lots of choices. Front desk was busy but not too busy. Good security. Doorman was pretty useless on directions and gave poor recommendations for local NY Pizza, but that could just be a matter of taste ",6/4/18,5
"This is a clean, safe hotel in a great location near Times Square and Broadway. The only problems I've had staying here is noise. The air conditioning unit in the room was so loud, it made sleeping difficult. And the walls must be non-insulated, because I could hear the TV and conversations in the next room as clear as though they were in my room ",6/4/18,5
I was a bit apprehensive about staying here as reading the reviews it seemed hit and miss but I can honestly say it is amazing!!!! Our room was a corner one with incredible views #2423 and it is in the most perfect location for a first visit to New York! I couldn’t recommend it enough :,6/4/18,5
"Great location, good price, where I always stay when in New York. I look forward to many more stays here in the future. Also easy check in and check out, and I like the smart elevators. Overall an outstanding experience as always ",6/4/18,5
"3rd time in the Row. Location. Room quality and service makes it suitable for NYC. Good price quality and nice environment. Great Guest Service!!!! (Even though u missing breakfast, everything is there) walking distance. Huge hotel and comfortable room. You are in NYC and you are not all the time in the room,bed is very comfortable. Great package delivery service. Enjoy!! Good staff,cleaninless and kind and polite staff. ",6/3/18,5
My wife and I found this hotel to be quite accommodating during our two-night vacation stay. The hotel location is great and the staff is very polite. I would recommend it to anyone planning a visit to NYC,6/3/18,4
"This hotel ain’t anything fancy, but the location is amazing. It’s an older building you can tell, and the walls are super thin. But overall it was great. Small room but you don’t need much when you’re in NYC. Just a place to sleep! I definitely recommend. ",6/3/18,4
"The hotel location is the best , just a block away from the famed Times square, the place to visit. There r plentiful of restaurants, bars , fine dining places just next to row NYC. The reception is at first floor and u have to look for it as nobody guides u. The check in was crowded and has quite long waiting time. But thats ok for place like manhattan hotel. The staff at checkin seems not be familiar with international travellers and their needs. It is kind of robotic receptiin. The rooms are small but this is the best u could get in center of manhattan. They give u water pouches and water dispensing machine access for free. A MUCH needed thing in US. Sometimes u feel claustrophobic in the gallery to rooms and spooky as well. I could not find any traveldesk that cam help u to manoeuvre in NEW York. Overall , location of property is awesome and u can find taxi anytime from here , even subway trains r on ly 2 blocks away. ",6/3/18,3
I had a wonderful experience with REINA during check-in! Not only was she pleasant and knowledgeable but she took the time to answer my questions and was a tremendous help. This location is very convenient-prime location,6/3/18,5
"A really good location if you want to be in the midst of things. Rooms are quite basic but we spent limited time there. It’s noisy, which is okay because your 100m from Times Square but we were placed next to a huge industrial fan that made sleep impossible so had to request a move ",6/3/18,4
"We stayed at the Row NYC for 5 nights and paid a reasonable amount for a Times Square hotel, but the room was very small and lacking in amenities. The room was clean and staff were helpful, but the lack of space made storage of luggage and clothes for 2 adults and 2 kids challenging. There was no refrigerator or coffee maker, so forget about taking leftovers back to the hotel with you. Beds were comfortable albeit a bit soft for us. Street noise from the 11th floor was moderate but not disruptive, and was drowned out by the loud air conditioner. Basically, it's a decent value hotel but you do give up a lot for the convenience of staying in Times Square ",6/2/18,3
This location was central on 8th in the theater disttrict but the rooms were very small and no other ameneities were really availabile. The gentleman at the luggage check were nice but demanding of tips.,6/2/18,2
"Just spent an enjoyable four night at the Row NYC. We have been coming to NYC to enjoy the Broadway Shows and have always taken advantage of the Row NYC (Milford Plaza) for many years and have always enjoyed our stay even during the major renovation project. The people are friendly and very helpful, the room was a nice size with have a theater theme and of course the location is right in the middle of the theater district and Time Square is only a short walk away. My only comment is be aware of the additional Resort Fee, that is added to the room rate each night in addition to taxes and occupancy fee, in excess of $30 per night. For us the only thing we used was the internet service. So why not include the Resort Fee in the price ",6/2/18,5
Dear Row NYC staff. Thank you so much for the upgrade! Was nice to stay at your hotel and the view from our room was amazingly great!! We would come again! The staff were very nice! Hope to see you soo,6/2/18,5
"Love the Row, its location, front desk personal and amenities. Great rooms and pricing for what you get room size. I recommend the Row 100% . For this I stay at the Row 3 to 4 times a month. Manhattan is expensive , the Row is a value.. ",6/2/18,5
"Great hotel, ideal location, clean rooms.... excellent choice. Times sq and all theatres so close. Loads of food outlets nearby which are cheaper than the main names in Times Sq. loved staying here, definately recommend. ",6/2/18,5
"Watch out for the hidden charges I had two rooms for four nights and had to pay an extra £213.60 for services i didn't use. I have stayed at this hotel before with no problems, but will not be going back as i feel i have been taken advantage of. ",6/1/18,2
"Overall, it wasn’t worth the price I paid. The room was really dirty and was just way too tiny, which was strange because I’ve stayed in another Row room and it was fine. A better hotel is probably a stones throw away. ",6/1/18,2
Excellent visit to New York sightseeing. Hotel was in an excellent location toAccess all the major sights. We had a very comfortable stay at the Row. The rooms were clean and maid service every day. We were given a water bottle on arrival and there were water dispensers on various floors to fill Your bottle. This was really useful and good to take for your daily sight seeing trips. Would recommend this hotel.,6/1/18,5
Good comfy clean room if not near the lifts . Good centeral location to Times Square and other places of interest. Breakfast and bar prices a little on the expensive side but hotel rates . Plenty of places to eat out or bring back . Saying all that it was my second visit to this hotel in Two years,6/1/18,4
Our stay started out great. We were a bit early and the person at the desk allowed us to check in early. Downhill from here. Our premium city view room was obstructed by a brick balcony of some sort (2409 was our room number). The room only had two pillows. We called and were never brought extra ones. We had to call again and finally they were brought. The fixture around the knob on the bathroom was falling off. Day 2 nobody came to clean our room and we didnt get back until 4 to shower quick before we left. But we didnt have clean towels. While we were getting ready to go to our show an announcement came through a speaker saying they were investigating a fire alarm and then we heard sirens heading towards our hotel. The elevators were also shut down. It turned out to be nothing but it was quite scary. The gym was awful. End of rant.,6/1/18,2
"As soon as you open the door, you can perceive the dirty smell, but the most discusting thing was finding the blanket, sheets and pillow case dirty and stinky. I call the room service and they transfer my call to the lobby and no one picked up. I called again and the said ",6/1/18,2
Hotel is located perfect to all attractions. Rooms are always clean and staff is friendly and inviting. I asked for a corner room and was given a great room on the 24th floor with a nice view of the city. My wife and I stay at the ROW hotel 4-5 times a year when we visit New York city,6/1/18,5
"This hotel is in the perfect location and for a great price. We spent no time waiting to check in and check out. Everything was very fast and convenient. Room was clean and always maintained throughout our stay. In addition, although the room was a bit small, the view on the 14th floor was great; we had the deluxe city view, which was near the corner and we had a good view of some buildings and Shake Shack across the street. I would definitely stay at Row NYC again not only for the great stay, but also for the helpful people. Maxwell and his security staff did everything in their power to assist me in a special request in having my forgotten bag sent in a cab to meet me at JFK before my flight. They maintained communication with me before, during, and after my bag was on its way to me. The entire staff was friendly, inviting and beyond helpful. I would like to thank the entire staff at ROW NYC for providing us with an amazing experience for our first time in New York City ",5/31/18,5
"Best thing for me at this hotel was that the staff was so friendly. Especially when I checked in, Cesar really helped me out! Since I was staying at the hotel for over 25+ days for a ""longer"" work trip, he made sure I had the best most convenient and probably one of the bigger rooms at this hotel - which was great and just what I needed.The breakfast is expensive, but walk a few streets up or down and get a fresh coffee or whatever you need for less... It's NY! The rest of the staff always had a smile on their faces, and the room service was great. I'm normally not a big fan of the cleaning/room services on longer trips like this but again, no complaints! Thanks guys ",5/31/18,4
"I have to say that the best thing about the hotel is the location, but there is a lot of noise from the street. A lot. You also heard everything from the next room. The room is fine, comfortable bed, nice views. We had a bad experience too with the cleaning service since they did not clean the room for 3 days of the 5 that we stayed there, after claiming it for two days and after insisting a lot they returned the corresponding money to the cleaning service for 5 days, which its not enought at all for getting to your room and having it dirty after all day outside. We had to ask for clean towels during those nights, it was unfair for the money we paid.The breakfast is not worth much, it is expensive and very little to gather strength and discover the city.To sum up, hotel is ok but you have to be aware of everything, they did not even know that they had not cleaned my room, and after the first claim, the next day they did not clean the room either. In a city like New York where you are all day out, when you arrive at the hotel, it must be clean and ready to relax. The hotel has to be prepared for that ",5/31/18,2
"Rooms were clean but small. Early check in and late check out was a great bonus. Take out food was ok, but expensive. Location was great.. not too close to the busy side of Broadway. Would stay there again ",5/30/18,4
Cesar and Junior at the front desk are the best. Great hotel....great location. Stayed the day before and after a cruise. Just a 15 minute walk to the cruise pier. Will definitely stay at the ROW NYC again,5/30/18,5
The only important aspect was LocationUnbeatable6am there was hot water with -3 degrees CAnd the answer was the person in charge starts at 7amI was coming back to NYC after 10 days moving around and reception desk refused to keep a big puppet I had been given at Uniql,5/30/18,3
The location was grate the room was what ever I only used it to sleep. The bed and pillows were amazing. The room was clean and the housekeeping was on top of it. I do believe the only thing I strongly did not like about the room was the fact that the bathroom door did not close and lock. The bathroom doors slide and have big Gaps in them so it’s uncomfortable to go number 2 if you are in a room with friends.,5/30/18,3
"Had a wonderful time had a room upgrade fruit delivered to our room amazing views over the city and Hudson. The beds were so comfy slept very well and being on the 22nd floor heard hardly any traffic noise a little from people walking past our room but that’s to be expected in a large hotel, cleaning was daily and not bad could have run the vacuum over once in the five days but we are quite clean people so no problem I would definitely go back for a fourth visit to the hotel ",5/30/18,4
The hotel is in a great location. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was very small but adequate for 2 people. The only thing I really didn't like was that the hallways are very dark and our room was in a little corner out of the way which didn't make us feel safe,5/30/18,4
"I have stay in this hotel 6 times,the staff can never do enough for us and a great location. But on my last trip in April, they helped me arrange a surprise that Made my friends first experience to NY & his 40th Amazing. Thank you so much. Already booked up for 2019 see you then  ",5/30/18,5
"The quality of this hotel was not what I expected for a hotel in Midtown Manhattan. The elevators smelled like urine and was filthy, when I booked the room the pictures was telling a very different story than what I got to experience. They are in serious need of renovations, I could be woken at 3 am by people in the hallway screaming at each other so soundproofing would be a good idea.The location was good considering it was one block away from Times Square ",5/29/18,2
Great location great amenities in the lobby city kitchen off very nice variety of food at very reasonable pricesBathrooms were very tight and the sliding door did not offer enough privacy while using the bathroo,5/29/18,3
"The location couldn't have been better; however, if you want the world's tiniest room and a dirty room and bathroom you should stay here. We will not be back. Terrible beds! You pay the price for the location since it's in Times Square ",5/29/18,1
"Wonderful & beautiful hotel!!! Can’t wait to come back. Service was great, very helpful, and felt welcomed. Rooms were nice, spaces and cleaned. Close to Times Square and many places to eat and shop! ",5/29/18,5
"Staff was indifferent/seemed like we were inconveniencing them. Room was clean enough, bed ok. Our last day there it was obvious someone had been in our room and rifled through our belongings (lights on that had been off, things moved, knocked off table). But there was nothing of value in there anyway. We had to check out in the wee hours gor our red eye flight home, so we let it go. ",5/28/18,4
"Location, location, location. Aside from that I strongly recommend spendig as little time in the hotel room as possible. There is a lot room for improvement when it comes to the cleanliness of the room and bathroom, the smell of stuffiness in the room, the smell in the elevators, the loudness of the air con every time it kicks in, though the air con worked, which is a plus ",5/28/18,3
"Great location close to everything around time square, and the theater district. The hotel was clean. We were given poor information regarding parking. There was not any valet parking that we could find. And we had to find the preferred parking lot and you must get your parking validated ",5/28/18,4
"Pictures are much nicer online than in reality. Quality of interior was not nearly as high as it is made out to be. Things are old, broken, and seems run down. However, Great location in Times Square area. Beds are comfortable. A/C was fantastic. Friendly door men and baggage men, but front desk workers lack customer service skills. The hotel served it's purpose, but won't stay there again ",5/28/18,3
"I stayed here with my family over Memorial Day weekend. It is very close to the Broadway theaters. For the price (much cheaper than many others) this hotel is a very good option in Times Square.The lobby is a typical Times Square train station, with many people coming and going and large groups gathering. The hotel seemed to be making an effort in the security area by putting “bouncers” on the main entrance. But we were not asked to display a key card during our stay and we were able to use the elevator without swiping a room key. Our room on the 18th floor facing 8th Avenue was clean and quiet. I would recommend a room away from the elevator, which is possibly the noisiest I have ever encountered. The hallways were dark and very warm, but the room air conditioning worked well.We had a bit of trouble checking our bags. Upon arrival in the lobby, the concierge suggested we see the bag check crew on the ground floor. After waiting in line there, we were told we would have to go back up to the lobby to get a bag check ticket, which meant waiting in another line before we could go back downstairs to check our bags. This may be the result of a legitimate effort to limit the use of bag check services to hotel guests, but it was inefficient at best and certainly frustrating for me.We will be back I am sure. We are hoping that some of the rough edges will be smoothed over next time. ",5/28/18,4
I was really excited for my first time ever in NYC to be crushed by my experience at this hotel. It's a great location next to everything that someone would love to see. The front desk staff really needs to work on many things before I ever decide to come back,5/27/18,2
"Stayed at the Row for a business conference in Times Square. The lobby is fantastic. The food court inside the hotel is AWESOME! We ate at the Sugar Factory in the Row every single night for dessert. The room was expectedly small, but very cool design and space-maximized. Insider tip: be sure to ask for a room on a higher floor so you don’t hear the subway all night. Word of caution, Times Square does not sleep - it was loud ALL NIGHT. Anyway, after the first two nights, we acclimated to the noise and it was more than worth it. This is a SUPER COOL hotel in the middle of all things happening. We will stay here again ",5/27/18,4
"Stayed here for 4nights with hubby, great location near Times Square and Broadway infact our room looked out onto broadway at the back of the hotel. Room was on the smaller size but big enough for what you need it for let’s face it in New York your not in it much just to sleep even though it’s the city that never sleeps. Room was clean,loved the day and night blinds, tv,hairdryer,iron & ironing board, little bottles of shower gel and shampoo etc, and complementary water bags to carry about. Staff very friendly and helpful and we enjoyed a few drinks at night, bar staff also friendly didn’t eat there so can’t comment on that. Room was cleaned everyday,requested extra pillow at reception and it was brought up to our room. Downside was a constant humming in the room which got quite loud at night not sure what it was,a bit like fan or air con noise. Also the extra $35 you had to pay at the end of stay, room tax or something so allow for this and yes it is in the small print. Lots of bars,coffee shops,and restaurants right there next to and over the road from hotel. Would certainly recommend for a sight seeing tri ",5/27/18,4
This hotel was just okay ... I felt it was expense for what you get .. the room itself is super small ... the hotel is dated with the exception of the main level which is where all the money has been spent ... the city kitchen. We had subpar service ... waited 15 mins for salads on a Monday at 8pm with no one in line ahead of us Won’t stay here again,5/27/18,2
"Great location. Friendly staff. Definitely Recommend. Great location if u want to be close to Times Square. Lots of bars and restaurants to choose from, great shopping,easy access to subway if u are adventurous enough to give it a go.. Overall very pleased with the property friendly staff and very helpful.. Will definitely be back and won’t hesitate to recommend to family and friends. ",5/27/18,5
"The good: 1. Location: splendid, a couple of blocks away from Broadway theaters and Times Square2. Rooms: very clean and fresh3. Elevator: excellent setup based on entering the desired floor on a keypad and getting directed to one of the many cars. Super practical for a skyscraper.4. Lounge/bar: nice and friendlyThe bad: 1. Rooms: small and NOISY. There's a constant buzzing noise of unidentified origin (not from A/C) that does not subside at night. It is *loud*. I'm a light sleeper and could not sleep without earplugs. YMMV.2. Front desk/reception: a bit disorganized. It took them a while to agree to honor the group rate that we had booked and confirmed. Overall, a good hotel; we got a great group rate and at that price point it is a 5 star property. I'm not sure it's worth the regular prices they charge, you can probably do better for that money ",5/27/18,4
Location excellent. City Kitchen selection of vendors available really good and the quality of the food and hours of operation excellent. Room cleanliness could have been improved. Staff friendly and approachable,5/26/18,4
"The rooms were OK, the bathrooms tiny. It wasn’t very clean at our arrival, and the cleaning staff dropped and left our belongings on the floor and in quite a mess... Location is very good though and you can use the sports facilities (indoor cycling) next door which is nice (albeit pricey) ",5/26/18,3
"We stayed for 3 nights and paid a high price due to nyc being busy (all hotels had hiked up their prices) and we booked late. Great location couldn’t fault this. Hotel was average and rooms were rather tired, eg worn fittings, chipped paintwork, marked surfaces etc. Room was clean and air conditioning worked very well. Be aware of the daily ‘resort type fee’ (I think it was $35 a day? ), which in my opinion is just a sneaky way to increase the room rate, although it’s sold as including WiFi and use of an exercise room. (WiFi should be standard anyway!). And before the hotel respond, yes I have no doubt it’s in the small print. If you can get this hotel for a good price location would make it a good deal. ",5/26/18,3
"I enjoyed a lot being in Row during my vacation in NYC. The hotel is very well located and it was awesome to visit beautiful and touristic places around it. And the bed is so good to rest after walking all day long. I liked a lot making the check in with the employee in the reception named Junior, because he made all the difference when me and my cousin first arrived. He talked to us about the hotel and the city and made us feel special and welcome. I loved it!! Eu gostei muito de ficar no Row durante minhas férias em NYC. O hotel é muito bem localizado e foi incrível visitar lugares lindos e turísticos ao redor dele. E a cama é uma delícia para descansar depois de um dia de muita caminhada. Gostei muito do funcionário na recepção chamado Junior, porque ele fez toda a diferença quando eu e meu primo chegamos no primeiro dia. Ele nos falou sobre o hotel e a cidade e nos fez sentir especiais e bem-vindos. Amei!! ",5/25/18,5
"I enjoyed my trip to the ROW NYC starting from check-in to when I left. Although it is super busy, you will be treated well. Junior at the front desk was fabulous, warm, welcoming and friendly, making me feel super welcome throughout my visit. The room was comfortable and clean. The location of the hotel is right near the theaters and Times Square, and if you need help with directions or suggestions of places to visit, the helpful people at the front desk are happy to help. Also, District M is a great place for coffee and a light breakfast in the a.m (thanks to Beto) or a cocktail or glass of wine in the p.m. On the day I left, I had alot of fun talking with Brandon, Kelly and Jarred. Thanks for the shots (photos) and the refreshing Spritzer. Highly recommend this hotel! ",5/25/18,5
Loved staying in New York here but the price is a bit too expensive for what you get.If I was to go again I would get a hotel further away from times square and just take the subway. The rooms are very basic but the hotel itself looks very cool,5/25/18,4
"Checked in at the worst hotel in NYC and had to check out immediately. Row NYC was close by, so I called them up and got a reservation right away. The room was perfect, so clean and just what I was looking for. I'll definitely be back to stay again ",5/25/18,5
"Close to times square,the hotel is the perfect place where to be. close to metro,to shops and to the broadway area. Suggested for young and couples. Confortabe bed,excellemt wifi and very nice and kind hotel worker from the front desk to the cleaning staff and the doors security ",5/25/18,4

"A very impressive, centrally located modern hotel with a mini food court at your disposal just off the lobby. Traffic flow in the crowded lobby is quickly solved with the unique elevator system. Enter you floor number and the indicated elevator will take you directly. ",5/24/18,4
the toilet and sink never got clean. Room is so tiny. the room at the upper floor make noise too much.the cover sheets are not clean. internet is super slow.I can hear noise from next rooms at night time.,5/24/18,1
"I was happy up until the day before we left, an item from our room went missing. Security logged this but nothing was done. Arrived home almost 2 weeks ago and haven't heard from the hotel. Personally wouldn't return to this hotel due to this situation. Otherwise the hotel is located perfectly and very clean. ",5/24/18,3
"We stayed here for 3 nights. It was great from the second we checked in. Cesar was the staff member who checked us in. He was so efficient, friendly & funny! Exactly what you want after a long flight! Every staff member we encountered were so nice, chatty & extremely hard working It is literally SECONDS away from Time Square, port authority for buses if you are going to the outlets, and the hop on hop off tour stops are all at your door stop!. We have stayed here a few times over the years and before the renovation and it never fails to disappoint!! I will be back for sure 100%! ",5/24/18,5
Happy. Subway and Time square 5 minutes of walk. A lot of place to eat around 5 minutes too. Room is small but clean. Beds are confortable. Valley parking works good. I suggest the package with valley parking include. Good rate for the car. Nice place,5/24/18,5
"The Row is ideally positioned between 44th and 45th on 8th Avenue. The room was clean and comfortable although air conditioning unit sounded as though it was going to take off! Staff were friendly and helpful. Only noise we encountered was from the street so although a busy, vibrant hotel the noise heard when in the room was minimal ",5/23/18,5
"If you want a good location and comfy beds this hotel is fine. I am not too fussy but for what we paid it was not of a standard I would have expected. However we were moved after complaininto a delux room, slightly cleaner and it had no smell which the superior room had. Would advise anyone to get a city sightseeing bus pass, great way to get around and see the city. A visit to Rudays for a beer and free hotdogs a must and only one block away ",5/23/18,2
Very small room not a hotel that I would stay at again. Room was not clean and hallway noise excessive during late night early morning. Security a concern as strangers could access hotel elevator with ease.,5/23/18,1
"I stayed here the year it opened, and liked it. Good location, good price, and cheerful contemporary feel. This time it disappointed a lot: housekeeping neglected to clean room still took a long time after we called. Lobby cafe chaotic and staff quite unpleasant/rude. Note that a daily fee of $35 is tacked on for wifi and an exercise room ",5/23/18,2
Nice hotel. Staff very friendly. Rooms were clean and adequate although could have done with more storage space for clothes. Bathroom a little small so felt cramped. Being on the 17th floor you would think you wouldn’t hear the traffic below but you can. All in all though a nice hote,5/22/18,4

Amazing time at the Row NYC - perfect locationSuper cute roomClean and efficient Cesar at the front desk was awesome ! Can’t wait to head back to new work and stay there again. The entire staff was wonderful,5/22/18,5
Just back from a long weekend in New York. Checking in was a breeze with a very nice man called Caeser. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. Security staff are nice and helpful as are the house keeping staff. Hotel is a few mins walk from both Times Sq and Port Authority so for the price it is an excellent location. We will be back,5/22/18,5
"There are few places that can be comfortable, close, cheap, and clean. Row NYC is close to Times Square, all the Broadway theaters, and great dining in Hell's Kitchen. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and well maintained; just like the entryway and lobby. The cost for this combination of features is usually absurd but Row NYC has extremely competitive rates; allowing you to feel confident with your decision. ",5/22/18,4

"This trendy hotel is in a great location! It's convenient to all of the theaters and restaurants. The staff was very friendly, and there was an inviting Bar to relax in after shows. Our room had a great view, and was larger than many in the Times Square area. ",5/21/18,5
Delcy with house keeping was very good made sure our whole stay room was clean if i had cash i would gave her a tip thanks again Delcy we will definitely return because we know we will have a clean room,5/21/18,5
We've stayed here twice and have been very pleased both times. Close to Times Square and nice views. It's not super quiet so not for very light sleepers but we had no difficulties with the street noise level.,5/21/18,5
"I took my youngest daughter to NYC for a day of fun. We stayed over at The Row. The decor was stylish with a combination of scenes and trendy artwork that elevated our experience. Centrally located to many of the cities greatest attractions. Friendly staff, great food. Look forward to staying again ",5/21/18,4
"The Row Hotel was good value for money and was close to all important locations. The room was clean and tidy. The room was small, but seeing it was only me it was big enough. If I was travelling with someone else, there's no way the room would be big enough. The gym was below standard, half the treadmills weren't working and equipment was dated. Other than that, the stay was enjoyable and comfortable. Would definitely stay there again ",5/21/18,4
nice clean hotel excellent located hotel on the theatre district a couple of blocks away from times square classy reception manager employee gave me on my last day an access card to all u can drink and eat from the bar one problem i disliked but its not a big deal the elevators are always full and busy and crowded lobby loved the room toilet the bed is comfy loved the portraits hanged on the wall the pictures which is on the doors nice door men excellent customer service ill definitely stay in this hote agai,5/20/18,5
This hotel is right near the theater district. Its hectic checking in but you can check yourself out. The rooms are all different sizes but larger than most hotel rooms in New York. I've stayed there several times and have always been satisfied. I did have a problem with the heater last time. It was March and I was only getting air conditioning. They came and fixed it right away,5/20/18,5
"The Row is very well located, you are in the middle of the heart of the city, with a lot of restaurants around and attractions. Hotel staff is quite nice and they support in whatever you need. The lobby is quite new but rooms are not. They have very old rooms, and they are clean, but sometimes, because those are old, they don’t see very clean even if they ar ",5/20/18,3
"Fantastic Location! Amazing stay and a great rate if you book far enough in advance. Gezennia at the Front Desk who checked us in was lovely, kind and we felt extremely welcome upon check in! I always stay at the Row when I'm in NYC ",5/20/18,5
"Hotel itself was neat and tidy with friendly staff. Close to the subway and Times Square. Beds made, bathroom cleaned and bins emptied daily. Good views out of the room. Had paid for a premium city view and upgraded to have 2 beds in the room. Got there and was only given a deluxe room. No refund on price difference. Had perfume taken, then returned a couple of times by the cleaning staff over the course of 24 hours, finally leaving a note stating they had ‘accidentally’ taken it. It shouldn’t have needed to be touched in the first place. The safe stopped working halfway through our stay. ",5/20/18,3
"The hotel has a central and good location, near at Time Square and to a lot of tourist attractions. Good quality of the rooms but quite expensive (even if for New York unfortunately normal); kind employees; for a nice stay in NYC could be a good choice : ",5/19/18,3
"My stay at the Row Hotel was perfectly suitable for my needs. The ever bustling lobby creates quite a bit of welcomed atmosphere should one be up for a most interesting and diversified crowd. This hotel, formerly known as the “Milford Plaza” is for anyone who does not object coming in contact with large but very well mannered crowds. The check in desk is extremely efficient and will help any hotel guest who is in need of their assistance. During my stay...I came in contact with several professional front desk representatives, all of whom should be commended for “holding down their fort” so to speak (Hotel was booked at almost a full capacity when I stayed.) Special acknowledgment to Caesar for his extremely pleasant attitudes and for being real and compassionate while I was attempting to add on a few extra days to my stay. Hotel lobby has a “computer area” that includes quite a number of “state of the art” devices available to all guests at any hour of the day. In addition to this there is a hotel lobby bar that is very welcoming with bartenders who are sharp and quick to make an excellent cocktail. The elevator system is perfect as all one needs to do is enter the floor number one desires and then one gets whisked away promptly in an elevator vessel that is quiet and travels fast. Lobby security all do their jobs with a friendly smile and make you feel welcomed as well as safe. House cleaning staff outdid themselves and are available to clean in the evening hours I’m order to accommodate a hotel guest’s schedule. Front door security is excellent with special mention to Edgar for taking the time to know whom the hotel guests truly are. Bell captain service is readily available to take your luggage to your room and my luggage all arrived safely and in tact. Hotel room that I stayed in was a “standard room” so it is small in size but not overtly. Off the lobby is a “City Kitchen”, which provides a large array of different cuisines one can try. Food ordered here was well made and inexpensive in comparison to New York City food prices overall. Hotel gym is large and quiet and very clean. In summation: great hotel for the price and extremely close to broadway theaters as well as so many fantastic restaurants. I enjoyed my stay there very much but I would not recommend this to anyone who gets intimidated by large crowds in lobby or masses of people. However, if you can deal with this aspect of a hotel then by all means book a room there. I firmly believe you will not be disappointed. Jef ",5/19/18,5
Well located but very noisy A/C that must be Off at nightNo kettle for tea or cofee that you have to buy at M Café at lobbyAlso I asked for a Delux City View and mailed for a high level rom but had an 8th floor with poor vie,5/19/18,3
"We arrived a little apprehensive after reading some negative reviews only to be blown away by the very welcoming, friendly desk associate Fernanda! She couldn’t have been more helpful and friendly as were all staff we encountered. Our room on the 17th floor was immaculate with a beautiful king size bed and two windows. The room has plenty of sockets as well as an iron and board. The bathroom is more of a wet Room but spotless also. A very central hotel for our anniversary visit to New York we would definitely recommend i ",5/18/18,5
"Friendly, courteous desk staff, immaculate fresh rooms with fluffy snow white towels and bed linens, great food and drink choices all under one roof, fabulous location. Would definitely stay there again ",5/18/18,5
"untidy, pillows stunk, rooms were tiny, bathrooms were filthy and front desk clerks were not helpful. we booked 3 rooms and very dissatisfied with the size of the rooms. the floors were not even vacuumed and the pillows stunk. ",5/17/18,1
"Nice room, good bathroom, fantastic service! Thanks Cristina T! I only stayed for one night so I don't have much else to say... The lobby is big and open, very nice property overall. Location is wonderful. You should stay here ",5/17/18,5
"This hotel really has no customer service whatsoever. If you are by chance aggressive enough to get a real human being on the phone or in person, they will not help you with anything. They are rude, inexperienced and they simply don't care a bit about the guests. ",5/17/18,1
Positives:Situated right behind Times Square so location is great. Negatives: 3 of us shared a double room and the room was tiny! I’ve stayed at the Row back in 2015 and they have just placed 2 double beds within a normal sized room. We all struggled to move around the beds without banging into each other! Wafer thin walls so was woken up every night by other guests chatting and closing doors.We stayed on the 12th floor and our room was right by an external airconditioning unit. This meant that there was a loud roar 24 hours a day. Lucky I travel with earplugs. When we were checking in staff were talking amongst themselves about completely unrelated stuff when we were stood right in front of them. If I remember one of them was trying to buy a new phone online...,5/17/18,2
Upon arrival the hotel added a 200$ expense for utilities they made available. This was non-negotiable and included the ability to use a phone which we didn't need. Also apparently some water bottles we never found?! A simple rip off. Other than that the hotel was noisy with small rooms but ok,5/17/18,1
"Truly enjoy the Hotel,Staff and most of all the Location. Close to Madison Square Garden, NY Cathedral,Macys, Broadway Shows,Time Square, Bars and eating places and the Subway going either S,N,E,W are just a few blocks 2-4 away ",5/16/18,5
Awful staff rude and unhelpful at best liars at worst. Lots of hidden charges taken without consent. Good location within walking distance of most things. Rooms small. Door staff rude and arrogant. Book anywhere else,5/16/18,2
The best location on town we could had. This was my wife first visit to NYC and I was very interested ion get a good location prior price. The attention and security we received were outstanding. Restaurant very delicious and good prices. DOUGHS... crime not to eat at least 3 of them !!,5/16/18,5
"Good hotel situated in the heart of Times Square area. Nice rooms, we upgraded to the larger room before going. There was no complimentary water as described, which was a bit disappointing. I did ask but nothing was done. All in all a good hotel for what we paid ",5/16/18,4
The Row in NYC offers quaint rooms with friendly service. The rooms are cozy and clean. Good food and shopping within walking distance of the hotel. I would probably stay here again due to the experience from my previous trip,5/16/18,3
"Delcy was amazing, she spoke two languages so she made me feel very comfortable since my language is Spanish. She is a great team member and treated me and my husband very well. And Carla was very helpful and friendly as well and tried her best to assist us ",5/16/18,5
"My wife and I stayed at the ROW NYC for three nights. The ROW is located on 8th street (midtown) so if you stay here you will be close to Times Square and the A, C and E Blue Line (subway). The Blue line can take you downtown (World Trade Centre), uptown (Upper West side) and either Howard Beach Station or Jamaica Centre Station (from where you transfer via Airtrain to JFK International Airport). So yes it is very central but please remember that it still is very close to Times Square and being right on 8th means that you are staying smack dab in a tourist hotspot. This is not necessarily a bad thing but I personally prefer a quieter street because it feels like you walk into a bee’s nest when you step out onto the street in the mornings. But I am sure that other people might prefer this to a more quiet location. When you walk into the modern styled lobby of the ROW you might think that you are in a Mall Food Court. The lobby is normally packed with people standing around but don’t be alarmed because most of these people are guests. The lobby is spacious and offers an a cafe’ with ample space, an amphitheater-styled seating area for hanging out, a small shop that sells gifts and basic items, the check-in counter and the entrance to a small food hall (very cool).A big negative was the check-in process as they make you feel like cattle being processed for slaughter. My wife remarked, “do we work for these people(the ROW staff)?”. The lady checking us in treated us like passengers being checked by airport security. The guys receiving our bags were very much the same, barking orders and then asking money for this ‘service’. At this point my wife asked, “are we checking into a prison?”. Honestly, when you have been traveling across time zones for 2 days straight, going from airport to airport, to reach your destination and be treated like this you feel insulted. The rooms are pretty standard and offer the basics of a typical hotel. They are modern styled, compact, neat and our room offered a handy little desk area where I could catch up on admin. My favorite feature of the hotel was the food hall that is located just next to the hotel lobby. It is vibrant and offers a variety of eats that will serve you from dawn till dusk. Personally I felt that the price of our stay compared well with other hotels in NY at that time. I will add however that the impersonal nature of what the ROW offers really makes the price seem expensive. I have stayed at similarly priced hotels and they certainly did not treat me like I was checking in for a prison sentence. I will certainly not be returning nor will I recommend this hotel due to the crude, vapid and soulless service offered by staff. Remember there are so many other hotels to stay at in NY so you don’t have to settle for The ROW ",5/16/18,2
"Good location, clean, a little drab lobby and corridors but good lift service. Staff could be a little friendlier. Compact bathroom but mini toiletries were really good. Quite during night. Bar and eating facilities on site but did not use ",5/16/18,3
"I have stayed at the Row on numerous visits because it is so close to the theatre district. The rooms are clean and the front desk staff do their best to resolve issues and make your stay stress-free. This visit, I had issues checking in because my reservation could not be found on the system but Cesar at the front desk resolved the problem. Be cautious of the additional fees/taxes for internet service as it affects your final bill. ",5/15/18,4
Good hotel. Great location. Room was small but clean and comfortable bed. Breakfast was sub-standard at the hotel so we bought our breakfast at the adjacent cafe. They need to work on that. Staff was friendly.,5/15/18,4
"Unwalcoming staff, especially ladies! they cancel my booking through booking.com just hours before coming, they force me to make an other booking directly with them.i came to hotel early morning, 4am. they get paid for all journey plus deposit (no issue) but they kick me out of the hotel, they didn't let me wait in the lobby to get me room key. i was forced to wait with my luggage in the MacDonald's beside. once back i ask if it's possible to have early checking....they told me will try once we have free room will call yiu or send you an email.....nothing till 2pm. once back to the hotel i discover that they have lot of free rooms they just forget noticing me....this hotel it's just once of my worst experience ever ",5/15/18,1
"Dark rooms, very small bathrooms. Poor lighting and exposed to street traffic noise. While Times Square hotels are very expensive I would recommend paying the extra $50 a night for nicer facilities. I will say location to theatres is excellent ",5/15/18,3
"Compared with my other experienses, especially in Europe, this is defenitely a too small room for charged costs of ~ 280 per night. It may be that NYC and the Times Square are justify that price, nur next time i'd choose an other hotel ",5/15/18,3
"Good location with easy walking access to Midtown, Central Park area and rest of amenities via next corner subway station with most usable subway lines. Free of charge water stations at every floor. 2 blocks from Times Square ",5/15/18,4
"This was in a great location, easy walk to Times Square and Broadway district. The room was comfortable, clean, and quiet. It had an amazing view. Staff was helpful. They provide a luggage storage area for pre check-in / post check-out, which is convenient when traveling. We were very pleased with this hotel. ",5/15/18,5
"Excelent location, near to Time Square, near to theatre at Broadway,near to bus station Hop on hop of.. walking distance to all main atractions of NYC ..near to Port Authority terminál, nice room, good services, we were satisfiet. ",5/15/18,5
"I can read quite a lot of comments complaining about cleanness, room sizes, service etc so I was a bit doubtful before checking in the hotel. Facts were total opposite: the hotel location if so perfect (2 minutes walk from subway the time traffic light turns green, 1 avenue away from Times Square), lobby is luxury and ""mostly"" secured, food court is of good quality, arrived around 5 pm and the front desk was not crowded at all, welcomed by Christina who took very good care of us. Just a side note regarding complaints, if the hotel is not alerted or notified, how can they acknowledge them and act? From our side, we booked a Deluxe room initially and asked whether it was possible to get a Premium one, we have been given one as available! In Addition, Christina granted us a corner room to get a better view and bigger size! Getting into the room, we noticed the carpet was not perfectly hoovered and some used small towels were laying on the floor so we called immediately Christina who gently removed two nights of service charges without even questioning. In sum, the hotel puts everything in place to sort out any issues you could encounter but only if they are aware of them! Only things that could be bothersome would be the proximity with neighbor rooms as per the thin walls so we can easily hear them and the air conditioning that is a bit noisy when running, very efficient though but during Summer, it could present issues at night when trying to sleep. Earlier I mentioned the hotel is ""mostly"" secured because evening coming the hotel puts in place security to check for guests cards before taking elevators in order to avoid any strangers, however not every guard takes it seriously.We met one that does not even greet quests and does not even check anything. Overall, I would not hesitate to come back for next visit as the hotel really takes customers wills into account and do their best to match them ",5/15/18,5

"My kids aged 21 and 23 walked away saying that if they ever get a chance to come back to NYC - they couldn't imagine staying anywhere but The Row! If for no other reason than its cleanliness, The Row is your place to go. Of course, staff, location, amenities, food court, exercise, bar, Sugar Factory exceeded their Mom's expectations. Thank you ",5/15/18,5
"Reasonably sized rooms, clean and not too noisy. Nice spot, convenient to City attractions either by walking, hop on hop off, or the Subway. The only downside is the intermittent sound of the AC unit through the night, not loud or grating just there ",5/15/18,4
"I'm currently visiting NYC from the UK and am staying at the Row NYC for 4 nights. I had been a little concerned after reading some reviews on TripAdvisor. However, I needn't have! I'm travelling with a friend and we reserved a standard twin room. After arriving from a long day of travelling, it was nearly 10pm before we reached the hotel. We were greeted by Paula and Christina T on reception, who were brilliant! Both were very friendly and helped cheer-up two very tired travellers with their warm and welcoming approach. Both myself and travelling companion are over 6ft tall. Paula immediately offered us a free upgrade to a twin room with Queen size beds. A lovely touch and very gratefully received. I had read that the rooms were small, but we didn't find this to be the case. The beds are a lovely size, extremely comfortable, and the room perfectly sized, with ample space and storage. The room is also very clean and has a large TV, iron and ironing board. The only tiny thing I would say is missing, are the tea/coffee making facilities. Although not a massive issue as we could get one downstairs, either in City Kitchen or District M (Hotel bar). My friend and I very much enjoy our breakfast every morning, which we have in the City Kitchen, located and accessed just off the hotel lobby. Lots of choice and various options all well priced! I'd also read that people were not told about the tax until check out. Not the case for us. We knew about them when we booked through Expedia, and Paula reconfirmed with us on check-in.We liked the lift system and had no problem ever getting one to and from our room. So far, we have had a lovely stay and don't see any reason for that to change. Oh, and our room comes with a really cool! Do not hesitate to stay at the Row NYC. The central location is perfect. The staff are warm, welcoming and friendly and it has lots to offer. I will happily stay here again, no hesitation. ",5/15/18,5

"Row NYC is centrally located in midtown NYC and is 5 minutes walk to Times Square and 42nd Street. City Kitchen restaurant provided excellent choice. Gym was ok for a city hotel. View down 8th Ave was awesome and hotel was close to the Shake Shack. Junior on the front desk was so helpful and arranged a fridge for our room, he was an exceptional customer service provider. Ann was our housekeeper for the week who provided both fast and immaculate room servicing ",5/14/18,4
"Stayed at the ROW NYC on recommendation of my travel agent Jash at A2Z Travel in Durban. Got to the hotel earlier than check in time of 4pm however check in was smooth, they have a luggage storage facility which allowed us to start some sightseeing of Manhattan before we got our room. We opted for the Superior room, which although is small, provided everything we needed - besides, you dont go to New York to sit in your room...There a 8 elevators but you might still have to wait a bit as there are plenty people using them especially during peak times. There is a bar/restaurant (district M) and the City Kitchen which offers a few different options for meals. The location is awesome, it is roughly a block away from Times Square. A 15 minute walk from the hotel gets you to a number of attractions including Penn Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal (above Carlo’s Bakery). Check out was also easy with no issues ",5/14/18,4
Awesome hotel location right near Times Square. Great hotel with great service - Robert checked us in and was very friendly!! He gave us a city view room and we loved the view. Good restaurants also right next door,5/14/18,5

"Hotel was clean but staff could have been more helpful. 4 of us travelled and we requested a room with 2 beds for my daughter and friend. Told not available. We were also on different floors. The facility charge when leaving is ridiculous. We had booked through expedia and told no more charges to pay if we paid in full 7 months before we were to leave. Utter rubbish. 2 rooms and additional $350 for 5 days. Left our luggage but forgot to tip and received the comment of typical british. Hotel is very central, and breakfast at Smiths (across the road) is excellent. Staff at reception too busy to give any tips while in N ",5/14/18,3
"Room was fine expensive for what it is, hotel in a fairly good location NOT ON TIMES SQUARE like it suggests but it is nearby.The customer service on arrival is fine...........afterwards there is a complete lack of customer service and staff don’t wear name badges so you don’t know who to complain about.Be careful to to have anything dropped of or delivered to the hotel........something was dropped at the hotel for us it was there for two hours before we returned first of all the claimed nothing had arrived then when they did find it after about 30minutes they charged $19.It would just seem in our opinion that because of the hotels location they feel they don’t have to try........the hotel needs a complete attitude overhaul ",5/13/18,2
I immediately knew when I walked in that I was getting a bang for my buck. Hospitality was great from the street to reception desk. During my check in Cristina T was very courteous and addressed my concerns immediately and in order. The hotel has more to off than I expected. Would recommend for a quick stop if you don't plan on spending much time in the room. Desk in the room is spacious and there are plugs a many,5/13/18,5
"Cristina at reception is great - helpful, fast and professional. She gave me an extra quiet room (well, for New York) and went above and beyond. The hotel itself is really well located and has great amenities including a hair blow-out salon just next door. ",5/13/18,5
Great hotel if you're going to a show. Staff were very friendly. Plus they offer a service where you can leave your luggage there after you have checked out. We also got a discount on our parking. They have a bar/restaurant too but I didnt have time to check it out.,5/13/18,5

"The hotel was not what it is advertised as! The lication is great, but nothing else is. The rooms were flithy, and so were the bed sheets!! This is a liw income residence as well as a hotel, which no one tells you until you stumble on to the wrong floor. Residents and hotel guests share elevators, which leads to long wait times for getting to your floor and back! Horrible experience ",5/13/18,1
"Location is great just a couple blocks from time square, plenty of food and shopping in the area as well. The bed was super comfortable!!! Paola was great, gave us tips on how to save in the city and things to see and do while in NYC. ",5/13/18,5
"It was our first time in NYC. Paola at reception quickly gave us tips to make our stay here even better and provided wonderful service. The room was okay, and the bed was very comfortable. Friendly staff ",5/13/18,5
Paola and Cristina T were very helpful and pleasant from the moment I walked into the hotel. I have stayed at the hotel a few times over the last couple of years for business and it is a nice and clean room at an affordable rate with great food and bar on the same block.,5/13/18,5
Close to times square and sights. Great staff (and I mean that from house keeping to front desk a++) but rooms are small but was out looking around most the time. Could have told us some info about hotel like ice maker et,5/13/18,4
"After a wonderful check-in experience with Cesar this hotel went from bad to worse. The room had hairs everywhere showing that it hadn't been cleaned properly. I found a huge screw on the floor that was blending into the carpet that could have done some serious damage had someone walked on it. It was obvious that repairs that had been carried out on a locker as the sawdust hadn't been cleaned up. After paying a substantial rate for this hotel that states that check-out is at 12pm (!) I was continually disturbed by house-keeping from 8.30am with them knocking loudly and proceeding to open the door despite me having a ""Do not disturb"" sign on the door! Guest are entitled to use the room for the length of time they have paid for it and shouldn't be rushed out. I have worked in the hotel industry and no room should ever be entered until after check-out time if there is a sign on the door ",5/13/18,1
"Really enjoyed our stay in New York and the Row hotel made things rally easy for us. Quick smooth check in to slick arrangements to store luggage, all worked well.We didn’t have much of a view from the bedroom that faced another section of the hotel so you could actually see in other rooms. But this didn’t cause us any problems as a trip to NYC isn’t about sitting in your room all day. Would happily stay again ",5/13/18,3
"Stayed here as 3 couples in 3 rooms where to be frank you couldn’t swing a cat, the rooms are top dollar but so teeny tiny, one room had a window which directly overlooked another room. The rooms were not clean either especially the bathrooms, the cleaning staff probably have a hard time cleaning as it is too small to navigate. I found the front of house staff very unfriendly and didn’t want to assist, the nicest person there worked in the coffee shop in the morning, however she wanted to know the cheapest place to stay in London as she was planning on coming over. Loved NYC but not ROW at NY ",5/13/18,2
"The bad reviews are justifiable. Go somewhere they appreciate your custom and care. 3rd time to New York, first time to Row, it's actually put me off returning. It isn't cheap either, if anything very expensive with all their charges for stuff you don't need or want ",5/13/18,2
"Magnificent stay , mostly thanks to Paola who made this hotel a truly 5 star experience. Can't describe how helpful and welcome she was. Aside of that hotel reception looks like Enter the void (which is pretty cool in my opinion ",5/12/18,5
I want to say thanks to Gezennia for great customer service!! I arrived to the hotel with my kids and The lobby was very noise. However She made sure I got a room right away. The room was small but very nice view. It's a great location,5/12/18,5
"This is our fourth stay at this hotel. It's positioned ideally next to Times Square and the Port Authority, and other, subway stations.The staff are very friendly. We were served by Robert during our check-in today. He was very helpful and efficient. He even discounted our resort fee because we were staying for so long for our holiday. There is a gym and restaurant available. We've never had a problem with the wifi, it seem very reliable ",5/12/18,5
"Great location. Very busy place, great food and bar area . Very good value. Rooms are tiny but hey you’re in NYC and you’re out and about. Overall it’s a smart place to stay and the internet in the building is super fast ",5/12/18,4
"Front desk Cesar was really helpful, but the hotel changed a lot since I was last here. I give 5 stars to the front desk Cesar for his attention and help. The location is very good but the lobby is very noise because the hotel has too many rooms ",5/12/18,2
"Rooms are small, but the hotel is very well located! The hotel lobby is cool and, specially in our visit, the support of the hotel associate Cristina T was really great and helpful! She really was making an effort to make us feel comfortable in our vacation ",5/12/18,4
"The ROW NYC is at an exellent location. Time Square is very close and also when you would like to have a little rest during the day, you can come back easyly to the hotel from wherever you are in N.Y. The staff really tries hard to make your stay to a good experience! They are helpful and friendly. The hotel is very clean ",5/12/18,5
Thank you Latonya and Cesar for great customer service. The hotel is nice and clean also. Thanks for the complimentary breakfast also Cesar. And Latonya for her great way of showing me specific things about where the parking lot wa,5/12/18,5
"Thank youfor the very friendly receptionist at this hotel. Cristina met us with great sympathy, affection, patience and attention not to mention the wide smile on her face, she spoke Spanish with us which was a great advantage, because it made me understand the whole process of check-in. Thank you Cristina ",5/11/18,5
"Thank you Cristina (the receptionist) for her kindness , ready to help at any time. Rooms have all you need to have a pleasant stay . The elevators system is great. The facilities on the ground floor give you a great help having lots of things at hand ",5/11/18,5
"Cristina T. Was very helpful with our trip. We ran into a lot of issues with our room and tried calling to solve the problem. We couldn’t seem to get anyone to help us but when we went to the front desk and talked to Cristina T she was incredibly helpful and pulled out all the stops to make sure we got everything we needed. Not only that, she was incredibly kind, warm, and inviting. She is definitely the face you want to see when you’re having a problem ",5/11/18,5
Friendly young staff  modern decor w/ great murals  great breakfast w/ wonderful pastries including chocolate croissants  easy check-in and check-out  comfortable beds  great views       would definitely stay again,5/11/18,5
Especially our hotel associate Cesar provided us with an outstanding never before witnessed service. We are looking forward to visit again. Staying at the Row hotel was a decision we will never regret. Clean and well equopped rooms. Thanks again,5/11/18,5
"Thank you so much to the lovely Cristina.T who was so very helpful on reception and gave a 5* service! Fantastic holiday could not fault the room, housekeeping or hotel in anyway! Great location also! Thanks again :) ",5/11/18,5
"I booked this hotel through Agoda and they immediately charged my credit card for the full amount however I was asked for a $100 “deposit” when I checked in. They said they will deduct $68.84 for facility charges and will give me back the remaining amount! It’s been 2 months and they haven’t processed any refund! Ive been contacting the hotel and several follow ups have been made but they are ignoring my emails!! Beware of this hotel!! Oh, before I forget - Hallways are really dark and scary esp for a solo traveler!!! Book at your own risk ",5/11/18,1
"The room was very dirty, dusty, and in poor condition. The management was refusing to change it for a long time. After many debates and complaints, they finally agreed to change the room but refused to upgrade it even though I had to change rooms in the middle of the night. They agreed to offer a $250 refund on $2,100 that I spent but I later realized that they only refunded $60. Candidly, I don't even have time to deal with them about the refund because it'll probably take 3 hours of my time, and it's just not worth it. Overall, terrible value for your money. You can get much better deals for the same dollar amount. ",5/11/18,1
My sister and I stayed here on our trip to NYC! We were greeted by Cesar who was very helpful and whom we had a great laugh with! Great start to our trip! Room was great and so was the convenience of City Kitchen! Great location too,5/11/18,5
funky lobby and rooms. location is great - close to times square and subway. slow checkin. security good. we paid for an upgraded higher floor room but it was still very noisy and the rooms are cozy. very small bathroom. a.c. and elevator both rattled and could be heard loudly. good hot water. bathroom had a sliding door and not much sound privacy in case you are not traveling alone ! good location and decor . great for a single traveller or cozy couple I wasn't happy about the extra daily hotel fee . over $30 mandatory. for access to WiFi and small gym. ended up costing more than other hotels when adding the hidden fee,5/11/18,4
"My girlfriend had a terrible experience. The front desk is under staffed to handle to guest load. Our room was about 8ft x 12ft. The mattress was more of a 3 inch foam mattress and was about 4 inches off of the floor. Their was no desk, no chair. You either sat on the bed, toilet or the AC unit. (RM 831). Our window view was the side of the building next door. The room price was $135.00/night (with all of the taxes & fees added in). The Bar was great! Will stocked and the staff their were excellent ",5/11/18,2
"I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. Our first room was filthy, skirtings black with dirt and I was scared to walk on the carpet. Next room was better for cleanliness but very run down and the so-called mattress appeared to be a thin memory foam layer which spent each night ruffling up. On trying to check out 25 minutes in a queue with only 2 people in front of me. Receptionists seem to think it’s their job to do that of the concierge as well. He stood doing nothing while I am the rest of the 30 people behind me simmered. The only recommendation I would make is the actual position is great. But there are other hotels in the area, in much better condition and more than half cheaper. So ROW NYC that’s the first and last time u will ever see me. ",5/11/18,1
"hotel has great location, the attendants are great pruncipally the junior attendant in the recption has shown the greatest attention to us. we are spending an excellent stay so far, everyone at hoyel always friendly and cordial. near the hotel there are several cafes and restaurants for dinner. I recommend fleeing the tourist hunt, price they offer for tours and visits in the city are extremely high and out of the real value of the attractions. I recommend using the subway and buying the tickets directly on the internet or through the internet. thank you row hotel for jos welcome so well. thank you juniors for helping us in our stay. have great dayhuglucas and cristianeBrazi ",5/11/18,4
"We had a great check in. Hotel is a great, popular location. Christina and Paola were very accommodating, thank you for your suggestions and your help. Hotel room is clean and bright. Style of the hotel very modern and funky. We would definitely come back. Thank you! -Carla and Nic ",5/11/18,5
"not my first time in this hotel, experience has been always good. my room was clean and everything worked. from the windows I had a great view. great breakfast and great coffee at the M bar. wi-fi worked perfectly. ",5/10/18,4
"Poor check in routines. Pre check in did not work. Print and pick up your key did not work. Long line to check in at 1 in the morning. The lobby is busy like a train station, too little space for the number of people moving around there. Tables, floors and chairs in lobby are not kept clean (dirt left over from meals bought in the adjacent food court) ",5/10/18,2
I stayed there from May 5th to 11th and the hotel was great. Especially the service at the reception was very good. The guy called Cesar was very polite and gave me great recommendations. Thank you! I will come back! five stars for this hotel and that great receptionist,5/10/18,5
"Arrived at the hotel to be greeted by the lovely Cesar! He was so helpful and even upgraded our room free of charge!! After a long day of travel he really made us feel welcome and relaxed! Hotel is great, our room is very big with a huge bathroom! Can’t wait for the rest of our time here ",5/10/18,5
Lovely start to the holiday and greated my a really friendly host named Cesar! Upgraded to a twin bed which was just ideal. The location is perfect as it was a very easy journey on the Subway from JFK.,5/10/18,5
Great location for Times Square and Bus Terminal. Plenty of eats and drinks nearby. Small rooms compared to most USA hotels but perfectly adequate for amount of time spent in room. Left luggage facilities for before and after check in and out is very convenient,5/10/18,4
The hotel has a great location. Be aware of taxes which are about %25 and which floor you are on.In addition they tack on $92 for water bottles and 'free' Wifi. The rooms are really minimalist and we had a queen superior city view and an 'upgrade'.,5/10/18,4
"The hotel is in a great location - it is a block from times square so if you are visiting NYC for that purpose, you cannot find a better hotel. However, the rooms are exceptionally small. I understand that NY is crowded and hotel rooms are much smaller than what we might be used to in other cities, but this one really is a glorified closet. For a two double bed room, you have to essentially climb over one bed to get to the other. We had issues with our bathroom sliding door and it was fixed within the first hour of our stay. The hotel itself (lobby area/elevators) is also very busy. But the staff is courteous and helpful. Cristina T. at the front desk was very courteous and helpful in answering a bunch of my questions. There is a parking garage a block from the hotel and the hotel validates the parking for $40/night which is a really good deal for NYC. Overall I'd say that if you are not spending a lot of time at the hotel itself during your visit, this is a great place, but if you are looking for comfortable/spacious rooms, I would suggest to book elsewhere ",5/10/18,3
"The location is great, right behind Times Square. But it is super expensive for a very tiny room, tiny bathroom, and relatively clean. it is a bit noisy obviously because it is a noisy area, and the view were not great from our room. But the location is super ",5/10/18,3
"Excellent location walking distance to Times Square, Rockefeller Centre, Bryant Park, Central Park, Empire State, theatres. Subway station on the corner with access to ACE trains. Main Times Square station less than 5 minutes away. Rooms are tiny but are very clean and have everything you would need. Higher floors have some great views. Elevators are very efficient. This was our second time staying here and were not disappointed. Would definitely recommend. ",5/10/18,4
"Our guest room was filthy. Outlets did not work in room so we were unable to charge phones which was a huge inconvenience. Bathroom door was broken - 4 people in one room and we had no privacy to use bathroom. Spoke to manager who said the only thing she could do was send maintenance to fix door. they came , fixed it but it just went back to being broken after first use. went to staff several times for questions but they were rude. Spoke in Spanish to each other and little did they know we had a guest with us from Spain so she was able to translate - it wasn't nice what they were saying about their guests. overall a terrible experience only thankful we were out sightseeing so only stayed in room to sleep. Never again would I stay here. too many issues and overall just plain dirty and unfit for families - I took photos of all the filth I found around the beds and in the bathroom - just in case our kids got sick from it. staff at front desk and managers need to get off their high horses. only helpful staff was the valet and bellmen, and some security - though most who stood at elevators were also ignorant and arrogant. again just glad we didn't stay long. ",5/9/18,1
"VERY well located, renewed and good price for Times Square area. The rooms are ok, quite small though, but still comfortable. They have the basics, meaning there are beds, tv and bathroom. No minibar or luxuries. But since you`re probably going to be outside most of the time, if you`re looking for a place do sleep, shower and leave the shopping bags, I`d definitely go for it ",5/9/18,4
"The location of the ROW is great, especially if you're planning to see a Broadway show, very convenient. There are lots of bars and restaurants close by. The Iron Bar across the street is great. Ask for a room away from the elevators - they are very loud. ",5/9/18,4
"Stayed here for 6 nights, here is few details:- Check in is 4pm. You can leave your luggages until then- Resort fee is $30/room/day for facilities like wifi and gym- No tea /coffee /kettle in the room. Each floor has cold/hot water dispenser in the hallway. They give you plastic cup. If you like to make tea, get a pack of tea, and get your souvenir mug early. Or, bring hot/cold thermos.- No fridge in the room- Right next door is a construction site that they start working at night. I was on 8th floor and I can hear them although not that loud that I can’t sleep.- what wake me was actually the fan of the aircon that constantly turn on and off and is really loud that you can’t hear the tv.- There is flat screen tv but some of the channel just pixelated most times, ie. the movies channel, bad connection? - Room has small ironing board inside tiny wardrobe with a safe (mine didn’t work)- The room is really small. Is very hard for two ppl with 2 luggages as there are no proper place to put the luggages- When we were there, our room wasn’t clean twice and we have to line up in the lobby each time to request the cleaning and waiting for it to be clean. VERY inconvenient still, even after they deducted our resort fee of 2 days.- Very popular hotel, lots and lots of groups and airline crews stay here, hence always chaos in the lobby and always very busy.- Please remember you will get charge handling fee for any packages that gets delivered to the hotel.I got charged $20 for 2 small packages that unfortunately arrived in 2 different boxes and different day from amazon- I found overall, is overpriced and not worth the next stayFew PLUS points- For first time visitor in NYC, location is right on 8th ave, 1 block away from Times SQ, Broadway, restaurant row, 20min walk to Central Park, walking distance to Rockefeller, Empire State, etc. so it is very central! - Staff are all very friendly and helpful- Bed is comfy but pillows are way too soft- When lucky, we had fluffy towels instead of old worn one- Bar and City Kitchen (small food court) right off the lobby- Security is goodSo, if you decided to stay here, ask for high floors, away from the construction side and bring a thermos for your cold/hot water and don’t bring massive luggages : ",5/9/18,2
"Nice bar and eateries in lobby. Management was STELLAR. Our AC broke first night we were there, and management upgraded us to a suite. Maintenance also came very quick to check on the unit. Room cleaning service was great. Location was AMAZING. In the heart of Timesquare. ",5/9/18,4
"This is a very worn out hotel, the former Milford Plaza Hotel renamed Row and, I suppose, a little refurbished in a way. The best thing is its situation on 8th Ave. adjacent to Times Square and a lot of restaurants, shops and theaters. Practical but that is all ",5/9/18,3
"We went to New York for a weekend in New York at the end of April, and we booked the ROW hotel at the urging of our friends who prefer the hotel due to it's location. It is located at 44th and 8th avenue, just outside of the main Times Square district. The location is pretty good: a subway stop is within a block of the hotel, and it is close to Hell's Kitchen. Most major tourist attractions were mere blocks away. I despise the area (as someone who used to come to the city regularly, i hate touristy areas, and times square in particular), but i cannot deny the convenience. Service though is a different story. Quite honestly, for the amount of money we paid for the room, the hotel's services left a lot to be desired. The front desk service was fine, but the line was LONG to get the key in the afternoon after we went to explore (we arrived to the city early and we registered, deposited our luggage and return in the afternoon to get our keys). The bell staff is barely doing their job, and they would not really do what bell staff is for unless you ask multiple times. The room was clean, but minuscule and the hallway was so narrow that our suitcase can barely fit through the door. The elevators were TINY and cramped and on some mornings we cannot get into an elevator for over 20 minutes as every one that came to our floor were already packed like sardines. The hotel (both rooms and public spaces) were dated (the security guard told me to stay away from the glass railings because leaning against it MIGHT cause it to break. Really?) and the hotel is in need of a full scale overhaul. Overall, it was an adequate stay, but I will continue my habit to stay OUT of the area from now on ",5/8/18,3
My room that was stuck on 78 degrees for one night and I could not reach the front desk or any mechanics.The situation however was then resolved. Room service only came to my room once even after I was told I was added to the PM service shift and no one still came to my room after I was out for 8 hours. The check in experience was a great with Cristina T,5/8/18,3
"No one answers calls at front desk from the room. Needed wash cloths and to figure out water fill station and ice machine, and it was very difficult to get someone at the front desk to answer my questions. ",5/8/18,2
"Check in quick, location was awesome, rooms clean and quiet and beds very comfy!! It's all about location and the Row NYC is perfect to get to everything. It's a big city and being close to the action and amenities is important. Second stay there and didn't disappoint. Thank you ",5/8/18,5
staff was friendly and room was clean but we didn't appreciate the room service walking in before checkout time while I barely had any clothes on (it was 11:40 AM). the hotel associate that checked us in Cristina T was very welcoming though.,5/8/18,4
Best possible location and over all OK. Staff not living up to the location and standard of the hotel and often not interested in giving service. The big advantage is the excellent location but value for money can be discussed. Refurbishing of rooms needed and especially bathrooms,5/7/18,3
"Excellent service. From the front desk, to elevator security to the kovely ladies and gentlemen cleaning the hotel, we received above par service. ALL were professional, kind, courteous and helpful. I cannot brag enough about the staff, the cleanliness and the prime location. Thank you for makimg our trip memorable. ",5/7/18,5
"Great, centrally located hotel in Manhattan just off Times Square. Perfect location for sightseeing tours, eateries, shows and bars. Be prepared for the swinging New York population!! We loved our stay at ROW NYC and would definitely stay there again ",5/7/18,5
"We stayed here for 4 nights and we were glad to leave.The hotel was very busy, lots of groups of students.The lifts were very slow and we had to wait for 10 minutes because the lifts were always full.The location is good near to times square, but next time I would rather stay at an hotel which is a little further away and less busy.We had to stay an extra night because of the bad weather (snow) so I booked an hotel a few blocks away. See my other review ",5/7/18,3
Great hotel in the heart of times square. Easy access to restaurants and broadway shows. Rooms were clean and all of the staff were very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone hoping to stay in the times square area,5/7/18,5
"We did the upgrade for the suite and it was very nice. I liked the two Televisions one in the living space and one in the bedroom. The room was very quiet and the bed comfortable. Easy access to the theaters and the subway to venture out to other parts of the city. The only negative is the elevators are a bit slow especially at check out time they stop at every floor for guest, even with full capacity, and guest will still try to jam in ",5/6/18,4
I was overcharged by nearly $300 no one would help me resolve this issue finally had to contact my visa company to get charges reversed!!! Toilet is also too close to sink and wall (touching) so makes it uncomfortable to use!!,5/6/18,1
"Great location close to lots, time square and 5th Avenue. Great restaurant inside and connected to city kitchen. We arrived late, but customer service was great, Shantelle was so helpful. Thank you for making our stay in New York comfortable  ",5/6/18,5
I was on an overnight business trip and didn't want to spend too much midtown. Location is very good (Times Square) if you're ok with tourists. Check In: I counted 7 front desk staff and only 1 checking in guests. We waited over 20 minutes. Not a good first impression. At least explain to guests what's happening. The automated check-in kiosks didn't work and no one seemed to care about fixing them. Room: Small but I didn't mind. This is an old hotel with some light renovations. I actually like the design but it can't hid the fact that the doors and windows are old and in bad shape. The bathroom smelled terrible because the cleaners used stale water. It was disgusting and I avoided going in there. The AC unit sounded like a 747 taking off. Amenities: Now the trend is paying $35 facility fees. The Wifi (part of the $35) cut out every 5 minutes for the entire time I was there. There's no room service. There's no coffee in the room. I wouldn't mind any of that if I wasn't asked to pay the extra $35. Overall: this is not a 4-star hotel they list themselves at. This is a 3.5 star max tourist hotel. Nothing wrong with that but to get higher they need to prioritize customer service,5/6/18,2
"Long wait to check in... You should hire more people for the check in. Got very little sleep due to noise of air conditioner. No instructions in the room about how to connect to internet. Phone headset did not work, not instructions about how to regulate air conditioner and I did not like the elevators... never seen anything like them. ",5/5/18,2
"We stayed in the row for 8 nights. When we arrived it was late so we never had to wait in the big line. We did see the big lines which we didnt understand since they offer you the ‘self check-in’ option. When we arrived we didn’t get the best first impression.. There was no bellman/staff to help with the luggage.. we didnt really know where to go. When we were checking in the frontdesk employee (never asked her name) never explained us anything about the hotel or discounts. I knew about the discounts cause there is a really big sign in front of the frontdesk but otherwise we would have not known it. Then she told us that we had a room (which was an upgrade) for one night and we needed to change rooms first thing in the morning. It was 8:30 PM not something I was hoping for to hear after traveling the whole day especially not since they gave us an free upgrade. E-mailed with the hotel about this 3 weeks before arriving. When I went to the frontdesk the next morning another employee (murielle I believe was her name) apologized for the inconvience and told us that the manager had said that we didnt have to change rooms which we were very very happy about! After that it got all better. We loved Shantelle and Nelly. We lost 2 buttons when we received our laundry back and Nelly took care of it for us, which we really appreciated! We liked the rooms it wasn’t super big but it’s not that we were dancing or doing yoga in our rooms. If you want a big room than it’s very simple and you just need to take a suite. Problem solved ;)Rooms were clean and housekeeping took good care of it. They have a gym on the third floor which we loved. Very clean and quiet. And they have towels and a water machine in there which was very convenient. Location is perfect everything is on walking distance.If you do not like the noise then again it’s very simple: don’t stay on Times square or close to it. Has nothing to do with the hotel.On our check out day we couldn’t get a late check out but they do have a floor where they kept our luggage which worked out fine for us as well. We spoke with the manager Tyler who was very nice and took time to listen to our feedback. Eventho the first impression wasn’t good we absolutely loved our stay at the Row, the staff and the rooms. If we will visit NYC we will absolutely be back! Highly recommended ",5/5/18,5
Cesar....is awesome. Great service! Made us feel welcome and went above and beyond to made sure are accommodations were what we were looking for... definitely will be back. Definitely 5 star service! Don’t see that too often,5/5/18,5
"Rooms - VERY SMALL and uncomfortableLocation - greatStaff - 100%First room was next to elevators - noisy and very tiny!! Not enough space to hang clothes for a business trip!! No coffee machine in the roomNot worth the payment, and very uncomfortable for staying in a business trip ",5/5/18,2
Great location close to lots. Great bar inside and food court lots to choose from inside & out. Shakeema & Shantelle were so helpful and great customer service thank you for making our stay in New York comfortable,5/4/18,5
"We got checked in by Cesar and we got a upgrade for 2 bigger seperate beds. He also send a engineer to our room very fast when our suitcase lock wouldn't open! We were very pleased with his service, great job ",5/4/18,5
"Good hotel in Manhattan, so close to the Times Square! It's suites are good sized and have good beds and sheets. Great Staff. They're so attentive, made me feel like home. Good internet quality. Cable TV is available at the suite. For those who want/need to stay in the city for a few hours after the checkout the hotel has a luggage storage area. If you are a Brazilian (like me) look for Junior at the reception desk! ",5/4/18,5
"Cesar checked us in, he was awesome. He upgraded our room for free and answered all our questions. Our room was clean and quiet, the location was great, quick walk to Times Square! We had a great time! Thanks Cesar ",5/4/18,5
"Great location, rooms, and water service. Really, really slow check inn process. The beds are very comfortable. The views are great. The place where you drop your bags for holding is a bit hostile as they remind you that they should be tipped up front. But don’t worry the guy said, “your bags will be okay. ",5/4/18,4
From the moment I walked in Cesar aka wohoo made the whole experience truly worthwhile and memorable for me! There are certain people who always make you keep coming back and Cesar is definitely one of those! I would definitely come back again just because of him as he has shown great hospitality throughout!! The hotel room is clean and we have a great view of Times Square. Cesar also went the extra mile and provided us with complimentary fruit bowl. I can't recommend this hotel enough! Book book book!! You won't be disappointed,5/3/18,5
"The hotel atrium is impressive. Once you get up to the floors it looks a little dated and there was a weird smell on the corridor.Our twin room was tiny, as was the bathroom. The bathroom was so small and looked modern at a glance, but you could see where they had literally stuck panels over the old walls as part of the renovation. The size of the room wasn't too big an issue as it's what you expect in Manhattan, so was fine as a base to sleep.We were on the 8th floor, but there was a noisy generator outside our window a few floors below, which made a noise every few minutes. This woke us up quite a few times in the night, even with ear plugs in. The smell the generator emitted was horrible so not a chance of having the window open. But the air con was great for temperature control anyway.The doors to the bathroom and corridor were 1cm too short at the bottom, so any noise on the corridor was loud in the room. They've clearly not upgraded the doors when the hotel was renovated.The hotel services charge was a bit outrageous as the printers didn't work, nor the fast check out point. But the Wi-Fi was good so we got our money's worth there. Hotel location was great if you want to be in the busy area near Times Sq and all the restaurants in Hell's Kitchen. Security checked people were guests before allowing them to use lifts in the evening - this was reassuring that they weren't allowing non-guests up to the floors. Probably wouldn't return as there's so much choice in NYC and plenty of nicer hotels for a similar price. Not recommended for light sleepers. I personally don't like the Times Sq area (so busy and beyond touristy) so I would stay in a different neighbourhood next time I'm in NYC. But our stay was ok as we literally used the room as a base to sleep ",5/3/18,2
Girls trip to the big Apple ... it’s a plus that the hotel hold your bags until your ready to leave the city... so after check out u can enjoy the city. only thing that I didn’t like was that when we got food and didn’t eat it all we couldn’t keep it we had to throw it away bc there was no where to store at hotel.. there wasn’t even a courtesy microwave at front des,5/3/18,4
"Your hotel has to be awesome if it has a Sugar Factory inside! The room we had was small, and I wasn't a fan of the sliding bathroom doors. It's a really cool hotel with a nice bar area. The staff was friendly, even when it was extremely busy. It was also a great price for such a great location. Will definitely stay there again ",5/3/18,4
"I want to thank and review Awesome Shantelle, From them moment she started with the check in, to going out of her way to get me a nice room, SHE GOT ME THE BEST ROOM EVER, a really powerful but extremely professional lady, she made my stay in NYC A PERFECT ONE! Once again/ Shantelle THANK YOU!! YOU ARE A DOLL! I wish the whole staff were as beautiful, generous, you saw me exhausted and made it so easy to be ok!! GOD BLESS YOU SHANTELLE!! ",5/3/18,5
"This is a well planned and designed hotel, There is a food hall in the lobby area (City Kitchen) so no room service, smelly rooms and food plates left outside for hours. City Kitchen has lots of good food variety and areas to sit and eat. The 24 hour gym is great as well as many computer desktops in the lobby to print stuff. The modern design of the hotel is keeping with a sustainable no plastic policy, fill your water bottles (which were given) at outlets on every floor. The front desk service was great especially Robert who gave us an upgrade for a discounted fee and addressed our needs and concerns. My only issue was the sheets which were synthetic polyester, so can heat up during the night. In keeping with the natural environmentally friendly theme, maybe cotton sheets would be a better choice for a more restful sleep ",5/2/18,4
"Great location, amazing staff and amazing room. We had a twin queen room which was ample size, the bathroom was small but who spends all their time in there?! Little qwerks like portable water bottles and reusable plastic cups with lids. Good view from the room and the tv had many channels. Yes there is some noise from the road, but what do you expect in the middle of new york? ",5/2/18,5
"Terrible rooms need a good clean, the rooms were way to small, staff was ok didn't go out the way to help, lifts were a complete nightmare, shower area couldn't swing a cat around, checking in wait time hideous - just avoid this hote ",5/2/18,1
"Every year we make a trip to NYC for shows, this is the best place we've stayed. Great location near theaters, subway and a food court you can get to without going outside. Our check-in clerk Cesar was great. We had opted in for a room upgrade and he worked his butt off making it happen. 26th floor corner room with wonderful views. The lobby bar has one of the best cheese/charcuterie plates I've ever had at a reasonable price, and the glass of wine was a decent sized pour. Definitely will be back ",5/2/18,5
"Just returned from a trip to new York and stayed at the ROW hotel, everything was excellent and staff member JUNIOR was very pleasant and helpful. the hotel was great it had everything we needed and it is in an excellent location. All this helped make a great holiday, we would return to this hotel again ",5/2/18,5
"Cool hotel, the best location in NY and great staff. Only the bathroom could be a little bit cleaner, but on the whole it was a great experience. Would definitely recommend and hope to come back soon ",5/2/18,5
"This is an excellent hotel, its in a great location, 2 minutes to times square. The staff are very helpful there's always someone in the reception information section to offer help with directions and give you a map or answer any question, the rooms are small but clean and nice, I'd say this hotel adequately priced! I'd definitely stay there again! ",5/2/18,5
"This hotel is right in Theater land. 2 Mins to Times Square and beyond. Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast is convenient but maybe City next door was cheaper and less busy early in morning. Room 2207 was super. City view with comfy beds and great wi fi. Safe is included and water bottlesLifts are always busy but a good system is in place,dial in floor and lift takes you there.A super hotel to stay in NYC ",5/2/18,5
"First of all, the staff were extremely helpful from the reception team to the bar staff. Our room was a beautiful double suite facing Times Square and the H&M building (pictured below) The location of this hotel is everything. We walked to Times Square (2 minutes), Central Park (15 minutes), Empire State Building (20/25 minutes), Rockefeller (15 mins walk) and we took an uber to Battery Park to see the World Trade Center and catch the ferry to liberty island ($20 each way, very cheap and more pleasant than taking the subway) Our beds were very comfortable and our rooms were immaculately tidy. Having a bad hotel will ruin a trip and with so many in New York to choose from it felt like we’d won the lottery with the level of luxury we had stumbled upon. We loved our trip so much, we are returning next year ",5/2/18,5
I have visited Row NYC on 30 April 2018 and Mr. Douglas was very helpful to our family. He provided useful information such as good restaurant in NYC and interested attraction in NYC so we are very appreciated,5/1/18,5
Long weekend get away. Didn’t know much about this hotel but liked location. It lived up to the reviews I read. Staff was top notch. Rooms small but clean and served the purpose for sleep. Bathroom was clean and well lighted,5/1/18,5
"Row NYC has a great location and fabulous staff. Everyone from Yanelly at the front desk, to her supervisor Michelle, and other team members Helena and Michael were helpful and accommodating when I visited with my 80 year old mother. I highly recommend this hotel if you want comfortable rooms , great service and a central, iconic NYC location. I've recommended to friends and family and will definitely stay there again ",5/1/18,5
Great location! Great price! I have stayed here more than once. The bartender Josie and staff was beyond friendly. Will stay here again! We were so close to everything. Just a few blocks from Central Park and only one block to Time Square and several shows! Easy access to the subway. The hotel is very clean. The cleaning staff is very friendly and accommodating. We always love our free water bottles with check-in! I recommend to all my friends traveling to NYC,5/1/18,5
"overall a good experience. I would stay there again. the rooms were clean, the housekeeping staff was very friendly and accommodating. the food court was very nice - good variety of different foods and drinks. liked it that there was hotel staff monitoring who got on elevators at night. needed to see a room key before allowing to use elevators. for the most part quiet. ",5/1/18,4
"Jarlin Gonzales solved our problems efficiently and expeditiously. She always called us to confirm that everything was in order.One day, the room was left unwashed and the air conditioning did not work. Everything is solved.And as a touch of human warmth, he personally came to our room to greet us. Knowing the face of the people who solve our problems, made us feel at home ",5/1/18,5
"We had a great stay at the ROW NYC Hotel! From the moment of arrival, we felt welcome by the exceptional staff service provided by Junior. Other staff throughout our stay were always ready to answer any questions and assist in any way possible. Great location! ",5/1/18,5
"This was our second time staying here and will definitely stay here again. Location, location, location! You are close to so much fun stuff! Central Park, Times Square, shopping, Birdland, Restaurant Row..... and that’s just the beginning. ",4/30/18,5
"Met Robert and Douglas at the front desk, they were very friendly and helpful. They are also very charming people and it was a pleasure meeting them:) The room they got for me is on the top floor and has a great city view. It is small in terms of sq. feet but the decoration is very good that the room actually feels spacious. Awesome for one person and good for two people ",4/30/18,5
"I came here 5-6 years ago ... and really loved the place. Big room, and right next to Times Square. But I have to confess the service is absolutely not the same than before ... and moreover quite more expensive ! Not sure I’ll come back unfortunately ",4/30/18,2
"I always enjoy going to New York and staying at the Row Hotel. It it a great location, the rooms are clean and well maintained, everyone is friendly and very helpful and the price is great. It has a great coffee bar that turns into a real bar at night also with live music. The food at City Kitchen is really good! ",4/30/18,5
"Just like New York City - this hotel never sleeps! The excitement and bustle of Times Square can be felt as soon as you step into the lobby. Nicely decorated interior, personable check-in staff and clean room ",4/30/18,4
IT Was amazing. For my first night it was decent and clean.. Also comfortable and workers are great! I enjoyed it very much! I shall be back pretty soon!! I HIGHLY RECOMMMMEND ROW NYCCCCC! It was just great,4/30/18,5
"Robert kindly reserved a restaurant. We don’t speak English well,so we were nervous about telephone conversation. Robert thank you very much.タイムズスクエアに近く立地は最高です。部屋も広くはないですが女性2人で利用するには問題ありません。難点はバスルームのドアが隙間が大きすぎることぐらいです。5センチぐらいの隙間があり鍵はありません。気になる方は辛いかもしれません ",4/29/18,5
Room was clean and interactions with the staff wer professional and pleasant. Rooms are ok sized for NYC. The room was nicely decorated. We were on the 20th floor. Street noise was not a problem. We were facing time square and could see some of the displays and a reflection of the ball in One of the buildings. It is very convenient to all of the theater District and Hell’s Kitchen. We would stay here again.,4/29/18,4
"Stayed for 5 nights in April 2018. We arrived shortly after midday and went to check in, our room was not ready but we were able to store our bags and head out. We were told that we would be emailed when the room was ready. We headed to a restaurant a block away and by the time we had sat down we were emailed. After heading back we got back in the check in queue as the automatic check in was not working. There was quite a sizable queue yet only 2 people checking people in (earlier there had been 6) yet other staff seemed to just be stood behind the counter chatting. After collecting our bags we headed up to the room on the 11th floor. The room was decent if on the basic side. Think a decent travelodge room. The bathroom was on the small side but has a bath and shower, most importantly the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Location wise it's good, you're on 8th Ave between 44th and 45th. Times Square is one block away, you're right in the heart of the theatres and there are numerous places to eat and drink all within 5 minutes walk. Transport wise you have a subway station 2 blocks away and taxis are easy to flag down outside. There is a cafe bar downstairs but it's on the pricey side. If you want breakfast Mama's food across the road we'd recommend as a good cheap option. Does very good breakfast bagels, you've got plenty of other options and failing that there are Golden Arches one block down. Be under no illusions this place is basic. But are you really in Midtown Manhattan to spend time in a hotel room? If like us you're going to be out and about for the most part then all you need is a clean comfortable basic room and you won't get one cheaper in Midtown and if that's what you're after then this place is spot on. Would we stop here again? Yes we would ",4/29/18,4
"Terrible old room, very noisy from the outside and also the neighbors rooms. Elevators take more than 10 min to arrive. Very poor breakfast area and service. Super busy hotel with not much staff. Absolutely pricey for what you get!!! ",4/29/18,1
"Had an awesome time in New York. I recommend this Hotel, everyone was polite and helpful, especially Cristina T at the front desk. She answered all of our questions and maintained a professional and friendly attitude ",4/29/18,5
Such a beautiful hotel and friendly welcome! Rooms are perfect and cozy. Cesar at check in was such a big help and made checking in super easy and gave us a good laugh! Thank you Row NYC for an amazing stay & to Cesar for the help,4/29/18,5
"From the location and affordable rooms to the fitness center and breakfast options, ROW NYC is the best hotel in Manhattan. Christina at check in was courteous and friendly. I just checked in and am already enjoying my trip ",4/29/18,5
"During my stay at the ROW, I was positively surprised by the corner room that we booked. The room was spacious and had windows at both sides, offering a lot of natural light. The bathroom included a bath and had plenty of towels and bath products. However, the room as a whole wasn't as clean as I expected. I found two hairs in the bath and the mirror had some dirty spots. Luckily, the bed was clean and comfortable. When you book at the ROW keep in mind that you have to pay $30 extra per day for the use of Wifi and water cooler. This cost is not optional and has to be paid. Personally, I find this odd, because it seems like a standard service when you book a room in this price class ",4/29/18,3
"Our visit to Row NYC was fantastic, the hotel was in such a good location and was really easy to find! The hotel has everything you need including a great range of food and drinks available - we only ate breakfast which was really good but a little on the expensive side. The room itself was great, just a little small - it was fine for two of us exploring the city though, if we were there longer than 5 days we may have wanted more storage however we had a beautiful view from the room! We want to give Junior a huge thank you for giving us a few upgraded extras to help make our anniversary trip extra special! We will definitely visit NYC again and will be back to stay at Row ",4/29/18,5
"This is the fourth time we've stayed at this hotel and have not been disappointed. The convenience to Broadway makes it a great place to stay. The hotel staff is very professional and courteous. Several hours prior to our arrival, we were able to check in online and receive our room numbers. Upon arrival, we received our room keys from a kiosk and were able to head upstairs to our rooms. It made the check-in process quick! The rooms are small, but we didn't spend much time in them and they were comfortable and clean. The food court attached to the hotel made it easy to grab a quick bite without leaving the hotel before beginning our day. Overall, it was a great experience ",4/29/18,5
"My friend and I came to NYC for the first time. We were so nervous. However, a hotelman named Robert talked kindly to us. Robert is the best hotelman! He can speak Japanese, so we could communicate easily with him. Thank you for your kindness! ",4/28/18,5
"Let me start by saying it was a pretty cool place. The room was smaller than expected, pictures aren’t very accurate. 2 main things that threw me off was when we arrived the bedsheets has stains and hairs in them and the pillow case had a stain of some sort as well. The internet is included in a mandatory “resort fee” that cost an extra $35 a day on top of your price for the room, and the internet was beyond slow. Took forever To connect and then took forever to load pages. We didn’t try the food or gym. But we did try the bar, excellent customer service, friendly people, drinks are a little pricy, but doable. The stay seem friendly and professional for the most part. It is located in a great spot with tons of stuff near by. My overall rating is 3 out of 5. If pictures of the rooms would of be correct, and the sheets were clean I would of gave it a 4. I think the resort fee should be option and not mandatory. Because the only item we used from it was the internet, which wasn’t worth using at all seeing how slow it was. ",4/28/18,3
"Absolutely no. One of the worst hotels I’ve ever stayed in. The location is in bustling Times Square - convenient, but so loud and crowded, mobbed by peddlers just to enter the hotel and the cacophony of cars, crowds and choas is beyond bearable. Then you enter and it’s equally a zoo inside. A lobby with literally hundreds, if not thousands of people. Mayhem every where, people running up and down stairs, kids EVERYWHERE (and I love kids, but seriously... like being in a playground), lines every where for the cafe and front desk and a lobby filled with computers. Indescribable! The the room...I paid for the “superior” upgrade. It was the size of a shoe box. I could sit on the toilet, shower and be at the sink in one fell swoop...no where to put my toiletries or make up. Louder than all get out. A stream of guests running up and down halls, kids running and giggling, and doors slamming all night long. On top of the noise, the room was either way too hot and stuffy or absolutely frigid - no good way to set the temperature or air, and the fire alarm light blinked alllllllll night long; flashing incessantly in my face.The only plus I’ll say is the staff. Truly lovely and wants to do the right thing. But honestly, no amount of courtesy and kindness will overcome the circus that is this place. Never going back again, and it’s right across the street from my NYC office so it’s too bad because should have been my go to ",4/28/18,1
"ROW NYC has an amazing location and the staff is warm and welcoming. The lobby is fresh, modern and clean.Our stay was not a good experience though. We had some problems with our room that are not acceptable. The space in the room (behind the curtain) where you can find the iron and hairdryer had a big gap between the wall and the floor so you could see all dust and dirt and that felt not very fresh. Our outlet next to the bed did not work. They told us that they were going to clean our room (new towels, new toilet paper) at 3pm but when we came back no one had been there helping us with this. And our toilet was hard to flush so unfortunately it got full and we had no toilet brush to solve the problem by ourselves. When a man came to help us he did not ask how we are, if we enjoy our stay or something else that is kindly, instead the first thing he told us was ""I can see you have used a lot of towels"" and he said it like he was frustrated. Of course we did use all our towels we got since we did not get new ones. I also did send a mail to the operation manager about our problems and ideas of how they can improve but we got no answer and that also shows bad service.We actually had to check out earlier and change hotel.But once again, staff in lobby was very lovely and the staff standing outside the elevators as well! A big thank you to you guys ",4/28/18,2
"Room had a great view as requested and front desk personnel was always helpful. Express check-out was a plus to avoid the hassle. Also our flight back home left at midnight so they offered us no-charge storage for our luggage until 10PM, this was really appreciated ",4/27/18,4
"Just spent first night at ROW NYC. Not disappointed, checked in with Shantelle last night, she was great and really helpful and welcoming, even treated us to a complimentary drink because she noticed my date of birth on my passport - we’ve come to NYC to celebrate my 30th birthday this weekend. Made us feel very welcome and valued guests. The room is great, clean and perfect for resting after busy day. The bathroom is clean and the shower is hot and actually fast. Wasn’t too noisy on a night considering we have a room right round the corner from the lifts. Overall happy so far with our choice of hotel ",4/27/18,5
"We've stayed here at least six times. Referred Row NYC many times. We got a very small dinky room, horrible view. The room we requested is the same we've always requested. Just thought as returning guests to receive at least the same room as before. ",4/26/18,3
Never seen elevators like this. They have 8. You select the floor from the LOBBY. It then directs you to what elevator to take. MUCH more efficient. Usually if you have 10 ppl in lobby they all get on same elevator...right? This way it figures out who is going to what floor. I've stayed in more places than most people and never seen this before,4/26/18,5
"Just checked into Row NYC. Comfortable room close to Broadway. Staff are friendly, helpful. Christina at the front desk was fantastic and made things easy checking in. Several restaurants in the hotel are convenient and folks on elevator said they are good. Will check them out over the coming day ",4/26/18,5
"The position of the hotel is very good, near to times Square and near to subway (1 minut of walk). Thanks to Maurice for everything, he was very kind and professional.The only thing that need to be improved is the cleaning of the room ",4/26/18,5
Room 833 was located right next to the elevator and gave you the feeling that you were sleeping in a subway. I have reported this to the reception but was not properly treated. The room was kept clean,4/26/18,1
"The hotel has a great location, conmfortable bed and linnens. Its great for vacations. The gym only provides for upper body lifts, so a little limited for my taste. The food court is good. In just missed more healthy options. ",4/25/18,4
"We tried to use the express check in on the tablet because I checked in online earlier but it could not find my reservation so we waited in line about 10 minutes or so. We were upgraded to a different room away from the elevator upon check in. The room looked like it needed to be fixed (clearly missing pieces on drawers, broken side of table, paint on white drawers, broken hanger on the floor. My partner found a used bobby pin in our bed when we first arrived.) We went downstairs and they put us back to our standard room. Our last night and morning there, our hallway reeked of weed. The lines at the elevator were long, especially because I think one night there was a school trip checking in. I did appreciate that there was someone there to check room keys. For how much I paid, it got the job done for a short trip if you're looking for just a place to put your things and sleep. It’s very close (literally right across the street) from Shake Shack, broadway shows, and a lot of eating/bar options. The location is perfect if you’re looking to be near broadway shows or times square, but it’s not someplace I would take my parents. I’ve stayed here a few years ago and it was great, i'm not sure what happened ",4/25/18,3
"Wasn’t impressed with the place. We reserved 2 rooms, one with the parking package, the other with the breakfast package. The front desk staff were not warm or welcoming. We mentioned both packages but had to go back later to get vouchers that we were supposed to receive for breakfast. Same thing happened with parking. We were told we were all set, then we were sent back to the front desk because our parking ticket wasn’t stamped. Just a lot of disorganization on their part which was a waste of time for us. On a positive note, breakfast was excellent ",4/25/18,3
"excellent location, pleasant stay... loved the available options for food, coffee; walking distance to the best of times square. while i did not use their internet or gym, others who i traveled with did and were pleased. ",4/25/18,5
"Being from South Africa and being on honeymoon, we were looking for a magical honeymoon experience...and we found it! At ROW NYC, with the brilliant Cesar’s help, we found it! We stayed at numerous hotels throughout this trip, and this hotel stuck out as our favourite! We could not be more grateful to Cesar for making our trip to NYC as special as it was! Thank you ",4/25/18,5
"Was our first time in the ROW hotel. Was a great surprise how it was . Modern, comfortable, clean, friendly atmosphere, well situated.At the chek in desk the personal was friendly. I can't remember the name. Was a man who speak portuguese and spanish. Fantastic! I highly recommend it ",4/25/18,5
"Hotel was clean, bed comfortable, employee's very nice and accommodating. The negative is that the rooms are very, very, very small. My sister and I stayed in a room with 2 twin beds. There was literally just enough room for us to walk to our beds and get in. No where to put suit cases. We had to step over them to get to beds. No drawer space, so we had to leave our clothes in the suit cases. The bathroom also, was very, very, small. Just enough room to walk in, turn around and sit on toilet. Bathroom sink was glogged, as soon as you turned on the water the sink would fill up ",4/25/18,3
"The staff was very efficient and friendly. Check in was very smooth. The room was on the small side but very comfortable and extremely clean. This hotel has a great location- close to Broadway, theaters, Times Square and many unique and wonderful restaurants. I have stayed here on various occasions and certainly would stay here again ",4/24/18,4
"Junior at the front desk was amazing, he gave us tips about the city and places to go and overall information about the Hotel and surroundings with a big smile on his face!. The room size was small (as expected), but not an issue since we used it just for sleeping. There was a water filter outside the room which was great. The hotel breakfast was a bit disappointing, but there were City Kitchen next door and Shake Shack across the street to save us, so not a big deal. The stay was great overall, it definitely worth the money ",4/24/18,4
The only thing good in this hotel is the location. All the other services are too bad! The worst is the elevator! They have just a few and we had to wait about 30 minutes every day to go down. We were at 17th floor. You'll stay at the hallway very hot waiting for the elevator and then go outside in a very cold weather.. Very bad experience,4/24/18,2
"The Row NYC Hotel was a wonderful hotel with a prime location in midtown Manhattan. It was easy to get around to everything we wanted to do during our time. Cesar at the front desk was AMAZING!! He was so helpful, kind, and made our stay even more perfect. Our room was spacious, quiet, and clean. Thank you so much for an amazing trip!! ",4/24/18,5
"Location was ideal, room size and bathroom were small but not really a huge issue as we only used the room to sleep. Baggage storage expected a tip when dropping off and collecting our bags, which was a little annoying as we arrived before check in and flew home late evening so ended up having to tip 4 times ",4/24/18,4
"fair service, staffs are in rush, petform on own duty. Excellent location, no water complimentary in room Feel unsecure due to very crowded and not always check the card system in the elevators. Unfriendly staff at night time bag-service ",4/23/18,3
"Pictures definitely fooled me. The Entrance/Lobby was the most appealing. For what I paid, I expected a room that didn’t have stains on the walls, a cold shower and broken furniture. Maybe I just had bad luck with the room that was given to me, however, I wouldn’t stay here again. ",4/23/18,2
"The location of this hotel is great if you want to be near Times Square, the Theater District, 100 dining options, crowds, nightlife, subway access, etc. I'll be critical in my review below, but to be positive first, it's 4 stars because everything was fine, the location was great, and the price is the lowest I could find in Times Square. We had no problems or issues. Also: 1. Room was clean, fresh towels, no dirt or smells or problems. 2. The TV and A/C and iron and phone all worked fine, no problems. 3. Check-in was smooth, always hotel security and concierge and baggage to help. 4. Internet worked fine with no problems. 5. The on-site food court is very cool, lots of great options. Even calling it a food court sounds to casual; there are some great restaurants in the City Kitchen. 6. Staff was always helpful. We checked in early (not to our room, but dropped bags) and also got check-out extended from Noon to 1pm. However; my 4 stars doesn't mean this is a 4 star hotel. More like a 3+. This hotel is cheaper than more than dozens of other nearby hotels I compared it to. And with the cheap prices comes a few things: 1. This hotel is small. Very small. I would describe it as the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in outside of Europe. My one-bed room on the 15th floor was 130 square feet. That included the bathroom. By contrast, I stayed in the Crown Plaza Times Square a year ago and that room was 320 square feet. Even the Millennium Broadway I stayed in last year was 230 square feet. There's 1 chair that goes with a tiny desk. Plus the bed. A small closet. 2 small end tables. Don't plan to eat in your room, or do much other than be in bed. 2. Because it's a budget hotel, it attracts lots of people on a budget (groups, young people, internationals) and I'd describe it as busy and loud compared to many other hotels. If you're a light sleeper, staying in Times Square alone is a challenge, but also expect people to be coming and going at 2am, etc. 3. The main level lobby is fine and nice, but the floor with your room on it won't be too fancy. If you're expecting a fancy hotel, this isn't it. The hotel worked for our group because we were on a budget. Location + price + nearby food + no problems = 4 stars. I'd return to this place when on a budget. If saving money isn't an issue for you, I liked the Crown Plaza for example ",4/23/18,4
So there are several aspects to this review.... 1- the room: super small but you pay for the location so I suppose it evens out. 2- the staff: the front desk is super rude! Extremely... don’t expect to be treated kindly. There was another lady by the front desk... Danielle... ugh. So we asked her a simple question and she responded in a flat tone.. “I don’t work at the front desk.” Seriously? And then proceed to point to the front desk. Okay. 3- district M: drinks were bomb and the bartenders were entertaining. Josie specifically was exceptional! He made killer drinks and was friendly! Definitely worth 5 stars! Come here for a drink! Overall... you’re paying for your location... but if you stay here don’t forget to grab a drink,4/23/18,3
we stayed 7 nights in the Row mid April 2018. Met Junior at check in... The other reviews are correct this guy is a legend in his own lobby . He up graded us to a better room and made us feel so welcome! Hotel has a nice modern feel. Live music in the bar a few nights a week. The hotel has a 24hr shop in the lobby if you need anything. Very clean hotel. Rooms are great & are cleaned ever day with fresh bedding and towels. Central location close to bus terminal and subway. Walking distance from Times Square and all the Broadway shows. We would certainly stay there again,4/23/18,5
"We were checked in very quickly and because we were early, the front desk staff came and got us as soon as our room was ready, in just about 10 minutes. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and attentive to our every need. Our room was very, very clean and had everything we needed. The marble bathroom with oversized soaking tub and luxurious shower heads were a real treat! The room was right near the elevators and we never heard any noise. The hotel location could not be better. It has a nostalgic, old New York City feel, but with all modern amenities and renovations. Within about a quarter mile to most of the theaters and Times Square. We even had a beautiful view of the river from our room. Everything about this hotel was perfect and we will certainly choose it for our next stay ",4/23/18,5
"Hotel is an old structure, which does not provide any sound proof materials. Sirens all over can be heard every 5 minute all day and night. Room does not have mini fridge and coffee pot so you have to buy overpriced food and drinks at the TSQ area.I had a VIP room and I never got access to the ice/water supply room. My key got damaged and I had to make the check in line for 20 minutes to get it reprogrammed and get access to my room. The District M and City Kitchen are way over priced so we decided to go to other places around 9th avenue to get breakfast, lunch and dinner. Cristina T served us in a great manne ",4/23/18,2
"Our 6 Night's at the Row was a good experience. The bed was good, the room ok and the location on the 26'th Stock was perfect! Nice bed and no noise from the street. Friendly staff. The elevator system is perfect, we did never had to wait too long. We Will be back ",4/23/18,4
Just got back from 4 nights at the Row. It is an excellent location and they upgraded us to 2 double beds without asking. Have only great things to say - the City Kitchen has good prices for something to eat before or after a long day. Our bed wasn't made up when we got there - the manager was up in minutes to make sure it was. Our power was temporarily off on the tv one night and they had a person up in less than 5 minutes to have it fixed. Only good things to say about the Row. Will definitely stay there again,4/23/18,5
"It’s a very busy place, but the staff is great. Patient and helpful. Especially Cesar. Rooms are compact, clean and comfortable. Plus it’s a perfect location for Broadway lovers. Right around the corner from many theatres, Carmine’s & Planet Hollywood ",4/23/18,5
There was a very long queue to check inOur room was very small with two double beds making it very squashed and there wasn't much other room to move about comfortably. The location is good but very very busy around the front of the hotel which you would expect from times square but also the lobby area/downstairs of the hotel was very busy all the timeI wouldn't stay here agai,4/23/18,2
CESAR CESAR CESAR!! He honestly made my whole stay 100000x better. He was very friendly and welcoming!! Knowing people like him so thoughtful still work in this business give you peace of mind! Once again HUGE THANKS TO CESAR AND HOPE HE STAYS THIS COOL,4/22/18,5
"Broadway at your doorstep, and 5th Avenue close by. All the tour buses, shopping, restaurants an easy walk. Modern rooms and great staff. Safe neighbourhood. Thanks especially to Junior, who was very knowlegable and helpful as we celebrated our Anniversary from 14 years ago at the same hotel ",4/22/18,5
"Staff are so welcoming and friendly especially cesar !!! The city view from our room is great , room is nice and clean , beds are comfy, great location close to times square and central park.We are enjoying our stay so far ",4/22/18,5
"Yes the rooms are small but the location makes up for it. Close to Central Park, Times Square, Port Authority and subway stations. Very friendly staff, very busy hotel. Would definitely recommend this hotel if ever return to New York ",4/22/18,4
"Excellent hotel with a very good location,very close to Time square! Clean room and nice cityview. High quality service mainly from the front dest, Douglds!!! He was super nice and helpful. Two thumbs up!!! ",4/22/18,5
"Considering ROW NYC is very close to Times Square, the nightly rate for this room (one full size bed) was quite reasonable. The room was clean, but did not allow me to adjust the thermostat so I had to cool the room down by opening the window. ",4/21/18,4
"For weary travelers, ROW can be a god send. I was contacted the morning of my arrival. I completed the info that I would be arriving 3 hrs. prior to regulation check-in time. When I went to the concierge, she verified that my room was ready at the requested time. I got my room key immediately. There was no need to check my bag and return 3 hrs. later for check-in. Departure was just as efficient. Merely drop your key in a slot in the lobby and adios ",4/21/18,5
"Hotel room & hallways were dirty. Bed was super uncomfortable. Location is right next to the theaters, but there's clearly a reason it's so cheap - we definitely won't be staying there again. Also, the day we checked in, a cleaning person let themselves into our room while I was changing without knocking. When I slammed the door shut she said we should've checked out by now. It was a really awkward mixup on the hotel's part. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. ",4/21/18,2
Thank you Cesar for the great view of our bed room! Thank you nice staff in the bar.The hotel is really close to Times Square.The bar as a cozy ambience. City kitchen is a very good option for diner,4/21/18,5

Christina gave us excellent service when our room needed changing. We were very happy with the result as she was so helpful. Our room had a wonderful view of the city and there was plenty of space for us,4/20/18,5
"Our hotel associate Junior, did an exceptional job with check in. The maid service started way to early in the morning. Loved the elevator system which made getting to your floor effortless, though the hotel is very very. A zoo ",4/20/18,5
Foyer has been refurbished to a decent levelRooms disappointing - not as shown on the website. Food disappointing Staff friendly Double glazing let’s too much noise in Tricky to get lower cost hotels in this part of the CityI would stay slightly further away and walk a little further or Uber or subwa,4/20/18,2
"When checking in, we were greeted by the welcoming and friendly Cesar. He was so accommodating, gave us the level of service you would expect at a 5 star hotel! The hotel appeared to be very up to date with the rooms having a very New York feel. For the money definitely the best value in Times Square ",4/20/18,5
"Booked The Row NYC hotel for a quick getaway to NYC for a friends birthday. The rates are very reasonable considering the location, right in the heart of the tourist trap just off Times Square. Fantastic location for exploring the city. The rooms are small, pretty basic but very clean and well worth what you pay and the staff are wonderful. Special mention for Cesar who checked us in. What a great guy, made us feel very welcome and really took care of our needs. Super guy, great hotel for the price ",4/20/18,4
"This was one of the original mega hotels in Manhattan. Built in 1928. Boy does it show. The rooms are photographed using extreme wide angle lenses, they don’t show the bathrooms in photos because there is barely enough space to turn around. Both of these points wouldn’t be that unexpected for Manhattan...but the ROW missed the mark. Wall paper and slopped on paint don’t make a dirty room liveable. And a bathroom that features mildew all over isn’t presentable. Overall this place is gross, I’ll be glad to pay $100 more a night and go back to my normal Hilton properties again ",4/20/18,1
"Checking in with Cristina was a very pleasant experience. She was helpful, polite and funny.The hotel is great - quirky, funky but also clean and professional. So close to everything - right in the city centr ",4/20/18,5
"We absolutely love Row. We've stayed here about 8 times and it just feels like home away from home. The staff is so accommodating and the location is prime!!! This trip Cesar checked us in and accommodated our request within minutes. Thank you Row. Until next time..., ",4/20/18,5
"I was completely happy with our accommodations. The elevators worked, everything was clean, internet was included, and close to anything you could need or want! Helpful staff and quiet rooms! Overall experience was excellent ",4/20/18,5
I choose to stay 5 night at ROW NYC because of the location.I didn't expected a big room in NYC but it is smaller than I was expected.But the housekeeper did a good job on fixing the bed daily and make the room neat.But carpet can be upgrade... didn't feel clean to me.I love the food vendor there at City Kitchen. All good vendor there. Too crowded in the evening.,4/19/18,3
"I was in New York with my girlfriend for a week. We chose this hotel because of its good location (near Broadway) and at her recommendation, whom stayed at this hotel when it was still called Milford. But our nightmare has already begun at check-in. A rude staff did not make us feel welcome from the beggining. They put us in a room, supposedly overlooking the street, but actually there was no view as there was a small balcony of the hotel structure that did not give us the promised view (on the contrary, it blocked that!!). When we went downstairs to complain to another desk clerk, we were told that this room we were in was two upgrades above our reservation (I do not even want to imagine what the original room would look like!!!). The photos showed on our reservation did not match with what we saw when we arrived. An extremely small room with no cabinets or space to move with comfort. Also, another negative fact of this hotel (which I believe one day was already good) is that we were coerced to tip by the luggage storage staff upon check-in and check-out. There are educated and discreet ways of doing this, not forcing the guest to give. Anyway, unfortunately our stay in New York was not as planned. We thoroughly enjoyed the town, but the hotel left a lot to be desired.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!!! TRAVELERS: IF IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO AVOID THIS HOTEL, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO AVOID THE 22ND FLOOR AT ALL COSTS!! ",4/19/18,2
"Great hotel, though small but comfortable. Funny and friendly front desk staff. Enthusiastic and responsible cleaning staff. Convenient location. Complete and detailed question reply. A variety of delicious meals. Evening bar performances are also very enthusiastic.A hotel that people enjoy very much ",4/19/18,5
"I was in NYC to attend a big education research conference, this location was excellent. My husband joined me a few days after I arrived and spent time sight seeing. The location was very handy for his purposes. Our hotel experience was a very good one, we felt safe, secure, and the standards of cleanliness and comfort in our room were excellent ",4/19/18,4
Found the hotel so central and Cesar on reception was more than helpful and such a polite Man...The Room was very nice and comfortable and had a fabulous City View will definately return again next year,4/19/18,5
"We stayed in this hotel in 2000 and 18 years on it has been transformed. Full glacial sand blasting on the exterior brick work and full-out refit internally. You can find out all of that on Google. Back then it was a budget kind of hotel. Today it is also a minimalist operation. That is not a bad thing. The good news is that this hotel has the same principles of the touristic experience, but in far more vibrant surroundings. Price wise you can't really beat the equation between cost, facility and location. I began my experience in a room next to the elevators. The walls shook all the time. It was like having a tram line passing through every five minutes. The overhead light had funked out and daylight was non-existent because the window backed out on to a wall no more than two metres away. It wasn't good. I arrived close to midnight and reception told me report back the following morning. When I did and they noted the issues, I was given a new room. This transformed the experience. I got the kind of room I thought I was paying for. Since the Milford Plaza days, the artwork at the Row NYC is awesome. Some floors you exit and the artwork is so real You think someone is actually sitting in the corridor.I have more to say if you are coming here. First, I unconditionally and whole heartedly recommend this hotel. It is a great hotel. Okay, there needs to be MORE STAFF TRAINING in order for GUESTS to be treated consistently. Some staff are friendly - others are really frosty at best - black girl with partly dyed bluish hair when I arrived late evening 04-12-18, close to midnight, you were quite moody please could you have smiled a bit more like your male colleague who was on the next desk at the same time? You were frosty and not welcoming. I felt you didn't care. Moody female aside, my stay was excellent. I was not told this on arrival, but you should seek out the water and ice locations on each floor at different points. Basically source your soft drinks, wines and spirits locally collect. I was not told on arrival how to access the wifi - name, email, room number.You can get a reasonable breakfast meal from the hotel. But really my advice is to go to the Galaxy Diner - excellent breakfasts. Exit main entrance, turn right then second left and you will find it.The staff are generally great. Be prepared for checks before you enter the lift area. You need to show your room card then enter the floor before boarding the lift. If you smoke, then go out and step well clear of the foyer preferably to the left side where there is an ashtray. Be prepared to be yelled at in NY drawl if you do not observe this. One tip is to double lock your door once inside. This blocks entry. On my checkout day one service guy entered my room without even knocking half an hour before check out. I wanted to complain about this but didn't have time. Overall, I loved my stay at Row NYC. If I came back, I would choose this place again. Door staff and reception staff are brusque and need to soften up.If ROW NYC can actually sort out its staff training then that would be good. Some Row staff were Very rude at times and so I will not give it a 5. Most were great but some need training. But I do love the hotel Some of the cleaners and door staff you were so friendly - please weed out the moody and those with attitude problems staf ",4/19/18,4
"The cleanest of the room and the bathroom is poor, the price is over compare to the quality.

Great location! Clean reasonably priced! Definitely would stay here again! Check in was great. Cristina is awesome giving us great information about where to go and what to see and how to maneuver the city,4/19/18,5
"We stayed at the Row NYC Hotel for a week in December while exploring New York. I can not express how fantastic the location is. It is located only a few minutes walk away from Times Square, and right next to plenty of restaurants and bars. The hotel is within walking distance to Central Park - a lovely walk. The hotel's rooms were well furnished and modern. The room we stayed in wasn't the biggest room, however, this was expected for central New York. The check in and out process was smooth. Great hotel for exploring the city and getting to prime locations. It was the best value for money and location -, especially during the festive season. Overall a good hotel ",4/19/18,5
"People are nice, and room is clean. Location and food are good. Printing, WIFI, and international/national calls are free.The lady who helped me clean the room was very nice. But when I first stepped into the room, I saw a little dust on the tables and the top of my bed. One day I found a used towel still in the bathroom after house keeping, my blanket was not well covered. Another issue is that it's not easy to get your luggage stored ",4/18/18,4
"The location is excellent essentially being right in Times Square and next to the Majestic Theater. The bar and lobby are very modern and great gathering places. The staff is exceptional, so friendly and helpful. ",4/18/18,4

"Special thanks to Shantelle ! She helped us excellent at the front desk to get our rooms, small but everything you need ! What an exciting city and nice hotel on a perfect location for sightseeing in New York  ",4/18/18,5
"We arrived on Sunday 15th April, the room was 2424, it was so dirty, blinds dirty, skirting boards with black dust from weeks ago, bathroom room mirror dusty, decoration marks on walls, plug sockets broken, and a great big extraction pipe for a view which we could hear all night. We demanded a room change straight away but no rooms were available so we had to stay the night in it. Rooms are a little tired. I had requested to the hotel it was for a surprise 50th birthday, no mention or gesture of the 50th birthday celebration for my husband. No tea/coffee facilities in the room. This is not a 4 star hotel. The reception staff didn’t really promote breakfast at the hotel or any meals within the hotel. Yes rooms are noisy, constant horns and sirens are going on all night, but it is New York so we expected it (the city that never sleeps). Location is great for attractions. Don’t forget the extra $30 dollar tax u have to pay for each night you stay ",4/18/18,1
"This is a great hotel, close to times square, but not right in it! A block away from 9th avenue which has great restaurants but not as hectic as times square. Rooms are small but clean. Didn't eat at the restaurant attached to the hotel, but walked in and food looked good ",4/18/18,4
"Very good hotel, small rooms but they meet your basic needs. Great location in Times Square. Nice staff. Very safe.I also like that I could walk from my conference place back and forth. Even though, I had heard that NYC is not safe, I was pleasantly surprised with how easy and safe was to walk from the hotel to the nearby restaurants, shops, and places to visit. Please add free continental breakfast, or at least put a small coffee maker in the rooms. Overall, great hotel ",4/18/18,4
"The standard rooms are closet size and they do not follow through with the advertisement incentives. Do not stay here! Do not stay here! Run! The same advertisements were why I selected this hotel and they did not give me the $ for flight, airport shuttle, or Starbucks coffee. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT ",4/18/18,1
It is very good located in heart of Times Square. But is too noisy and there is a lot people. We had to wait for 5 minutes every day for elevators. The rooms are too small if you don`t make an upgrade,4/18/18,3
"I will not send my enemies to this place. Overpriced, sneaky charges on your card, room next to an elevator shaft - who designed that? Small beds, two people cannot turn around on their version of a double bed ",4/18/18,1
Stayed one night at Row in NYC. We took the subway and the hotel was right on the same block maybe 500 away. The location was just a short walk to Times Square. The room was clean but the walls were very thin. I could hear the family in the next room talking as if they were in my room. The elevators were a little odd and a few times we had to take service elevators to get to our floor (floor 16). I heard police sirens a lot in this hotel at all times of night maybe because of the location. One plus for sure was the food cart right outside the hotel.,4/17/18,3
"The bed was very low to the ground. At 63 it was difficult getting in and out of the bed. Also, I was charged an additional $103 over the quoted price. My credit card was charged two weeks before my arrival ",4/17/18,3
"Good hotel near Times Square... nothing exceptional, everything was average. Room cleaning could be better. Breakfast was continental with not great choice of options. Location is great close to theatres ",4/17/18,3
Nothing good to say about this hotels Hate the fact that elevator is controled on computer Breakfast room (?) looks like a street restaurant and certainly not like a hotel breakfast roomVery noisy lobby,4/17/18,1
It was a very nice and affordable stay. Everyone was very nice. I would stay there again if I would go back to New York. It was at a very convenient place. There was tons of places to eat and go to very close by,4/17/18,4
"It is very well located, near everything. The room is very small, had no place to store my luggage and neither to put my clothes. The amenities of the room had no place to be left in the room by the house keeping either. It was very clean everyday ",4/17/18,4
"We stayed at The Row for a mother/daughter trip to NYC. We wanted a convienent location where we would feel safe. Everything was perfect. The rooms were small but we knew that from other reviews. For the price, it was a great deal. We will be back ",4/16/18,5
"I’ve recently spent a week in New York City with my partner, and we stayed at this hotel. First we got dropped to our hotel, were amazed at the location (just one street away from Times Square) and it was right opposite shake shack (I’m a foodie). The hotel itself is amazing, the reception/lobby was so chic, it had a bar, restaurant and a gift shop which was 24 hours. Also, right next door to the hotel was SUGAR, an absolutely amazing sweet shop. We checked in, paid a $350 dollar fee straight up (kind of sucks) which we got half back at the end of our stay, this was annoying as we didn’t get to spend that money because we were going home. Our room was small, and we had a view of the next building from our window, which didn’t really matter at all. Double bed, a desk, a tv, bath and shower, air con/heating, safe, etc. Everything you need to enjoy a stay at NYC. It got cleaned everyday with fresh towels too. The only annoying part of this hotel was that we had to get our room card out and display it every time we went into the hotel, which doesn’t seem like much but when you have your arms full of stuff it can be a hassle. Other than this small issue the stay at Row NYC was fabulous, would definitely recommend and would definitely go back next time. ",4/16/18,5

Good location and staff reception. Optimize the time. Only problem is the level of the music on the hall.The fast food is ok and there are many services places around.For who like Times Square is a great option,4/16/18,3
Great location for those who want to stay on Broadway. It is an old building with retrofit and with many rooms however this does not compromise the quality. Impeccable cleaning. Reformed in the past already shows signs of wear and needs renovation in the rooms besides the modernization of the air conditioning system (refrigeration and very noisy heating). New dining options are a differential. The staff were very helpful. The policy of collection of resort rate in NYC hotels brings budget impact with minimal benefi,4/16/18,4
"The best Hotel In New York . Every team lovely and Friendely . I recommend. The Location excellent, near times square, train, central park. Near Every espetaculous of brodway, its grat!!! Thanks Row and every team ",4/16/18,5
"The staff were really very nice, noticed my height and made sure I had a bed that would fit me--giving me a free upgrade. I haven't had service like that in a hotel in a long time. While it was noisy outside, I don't really know what you can expect in an NYC hotel and people honk their car horns.The hot water in the shower was sometimes just warm, sometimes hot, and sometimes cold. Other than that, really great place ",4/16/18,4
This is my 2nd time staying here in 3 weeks! Great location for everything NYC has to offer! I love the restaurants upstairs attached to the ROW! The ramen spot and DOUGH I couldn't get enough of! I will be back in 2 weeks,4/16/18,5
"I do not recommend ROW NYC. The room was nothing like the internet pictures. Very dirty. Paint chips on the floors, cracked tiles, dusty and needed a good paint job on the walls( without dripping on the floor ",4/16/18,1
"I was very disappointed with the room . They gave me a room that I initially thought was a broom closet, right next to the elevator. The hotel staff was nice enough to give me a new room on my second night, but damage has been done. I will not return to that hotel ",4/15/18,2
Row was a great hotel located right in the heart of all the action near time square. Just steps away from the main avenue there was lots to see and do. The room wasn't very large but it was clean and all we needed for sleeping and storing our things. Cristina T welcomed us at the front desk when we arrived with a smile. She was very helpful in answering any questions we had and was a great start to a fantastic trip,4/15/18,5
"This was our third time staying at Row NYC for our annual “sister weekend.” We have always enjoyed staying at Row, and continued to return because of the great location, convenience of the hotel’s bar and the restaurants in the adjacent City Kitchen. Of course, the most important factor for our returning year after year has been the consistently friendly service! We’ve been lucky enough to kick off each of our stays with the friendly and exceptional welcome by Cesar at the front desk checkin! Our room was great and we had a fabulous weekend! Thanks so much! Hope to see you next year Cesar ",4/15/18,5
"My sister’s and I have been coming to this hotel every April for three years when we have our yearly sister weekend. We love it so much and look forward to coming every year. Employees like Cesar make our trip extra special because he is always so helpful and very funny. We remembered him from last year when we checked in! We will keep coming back to this hotel for the location, City Kitchen, and Cesar. Thank you for such a fun and lovely weekend!!!! ",4/15/18,5
"2nd stay this year and likely last. Location is great! However, too many issues. Lost power to my room. I spent 30 minutes calling to get it fixed, nobody picked up the phone. So I had to go to the front desk to report. I was accosted by 3 drug dealers at the entrance of the hotel upon returning from late dinner. Seemed like there was a lot of security all day and evening, but nobody late evening ",4/15/18,3

We had Cristina T assist us with check in and she was very professional and went the extra step to ensure that our stay was comfortable. She had excellent recommendations and even offered a drink coupon since we had a long flight and were in dire need of a drink. Thank you Cristin,4/14/18,5
"Check in with Christine was a breeze. She was super helpful when trying to find my reservation. Very friendly and courteous especially when I checked in super late (around midnight). The next day, Robert was awesome in helping me book a bigger room since we had so many guests. He went above and beyond to make my stay pleasant ",4/14/18,5
Don’t get there before 4 or you’ll wait for your room with no updates and if you do ask expect attitude. If you check your bags in that is complimentary the first thing the staff tells you is for a tip which is fine when they bring the bags but for just checking them in is ridiculous. If you want to be by Time Square it’s not very far from it so food choices and shopping is nice. Plus if your site seeing a lot of the major buildings are within 15 mins of the hotel,4/14/18,3
"The hotel is very central and a 2 min walk to Times Square. It's also clean with food options downstairs. The price is fair for the location. Some of the staff are lazy. Would I stay here again? Perhaps. But, I'd search another place first because of the attitude of the staff ",4/14/18,3

The entire experience in this hotel was excellent: from the room and it’s cleanliness to its location and everything else. We got a room upgrade in order to be in a bigger room and the view was amazing. Zac and Paola were so so helpful  actually they were amazing. They made our stay pleasant and enjoyable. If you are visiting for work or vacation this is the hotel to be. I’ll be back to the Row NYC at Times Square next time I’m in the city. Thank you Zac and Paola,4/13/18,5

"I stayed at the ROW for 7 nights. before booking I read the reviews that mention it was a busy hotel and was wondering what is the big deal with ""busy hotel"".1. so first of all -try to get an elevator at morning... sometimes it takes up to 10-15 min to get an elevator!!! (im not joking)2. the hotel lobby is always busy and you have to show the hotel keys to security every time u with the get to the elevators area at night. 3. room isolation is poor.. very poor. you can hear EVERYTHING across the wall... good luck trying to sleep at night when your next door guest is returning and yelling at the hotel stuff4. you can hear street noise from 8th avenue, so if you are as noise-sensitive, DON'T get the city view rooms5. rooms - the rooms are not that clean. it just like that.all in all - this is a relatively poor hotel that is pretending to be something that its no ",4/12/18,2
"We were welcomed by Cesar and made feel comfortable right away. We had a room on the 28th floor which was basic but clean. The staff was really nice. At times the hotel was so busy that we had to wait a long time for the elevators. Any inconvenience was compensated by the perfect location. Close to the Broadway shows and Times Square, but not expensive. Within walking distance to museums, restaurants and NYC nightlife it’s the perfect choice for a short stay in the city ",4/12/18,4
Not as mentioned in the booking website i booked deluxe room but it wasn’t deluxe and was a corner room the room was cold the heater was not working at all just for decoration the outside temperature was 2-3 degrees and i just felt like i am in the Alaska in the room really i was disappointed by the hotel and i didn’t waste my time and tell them anout the problem because they will be an something to get from the problem,4/12/18,1
"This big hotel is in the heart of big Apple , very convenient, also very busy made u feel dizzy too, you must wait for 4 pm to get into your room even u check in earlier ! I have reserved a superior room but the front desk just gave me a starred room at 26 floor , she said it’s upgrade! However this standard room is small enough to fit myself only, the bathroom shower is tightly hard for you to move around , the room is clean but still a bit of uncomfortable ! Plus the ice machine right in front of my room , horrible noise bothered me all night hard to sleep too! If u are looking for comfort, better stay in the Intercontiental Hotel right cross street , this is a simple practical hotel only  ",4/12/18,3
Good location to the shows and plays . The food court in the hotel has an excellent lobster roll and also do nuts . The taxis were abundant near the hotel as well as pizza by the slice joints . Friendly front desk help .,4/12/18,3
"Row Hotel New York good hotel a shame they didn’t have more elevators. Close to all ammenities really enjoyed my time there. Visited 911 memorial sunset boat trip, all enjoyable food was an ok price not to expensive ",4/12/18,3

"I flew in from Chicago this morning for Day Surgery. When I initially try to check in, I was told there were no rooms available and I had to wait till 4pm. I decided to speak to the Front Desk Agent Cesar. I told him my situation and how much pain I was in because of the surgery. He got a room for me and my husband right away, upgraded it and got someone to bring my bags because I couldn't lift anything. Now this is what I call customer service. The hotel is clean and trendy. Very boutique like. Great location, Great food and friendly staff. Thank you again Cesa ",4/12/18,5
"Spend 5 days in this lovely hotelRooms were clean, fresh and beds were comfortable, plenty of room to put your clothes and wardrobe to hang things up in, safe in room which was easy to operate, complementary wifi in rooms, you could use the phone in the room to call back home in England. Large TV in room, with plenty of stations to watch, hairdryer in room to use. Bathroom was small, but you only shower/bath and use the toilet, plenty of hot water all through the day, staff friendly and welcoming. Lifts were speedy, all you had to do was put in the floor number and it told you what lift to get in never waited more than a minute before it came.It was only about a five minute walk to Times Square, with plenty of shops to look at on the way, subway station 2 second walk from hotel, subways are really clean and trains are very clean, it lets you know what station is coming next and if you want to go to ground zero, get the E train which goes directly there, stopping at other stations on the way ",4/12/18,5
"Stayed in the Row Hotel for 3 nights from the 7th of April. Location is great and that is about it. 1st night we were given a tiny room with no space for suitcases never mind to swing a cat. Was informed after a lengthy chat we would be moved to a better room for rest of stay the next day. Next Day: Another lengthy check-in, another queue to get to room (massive school party, checking in at same time), another 20 minute wait for lift. Lifts are a joke and system in operation is not working!! Arrive at room opposite ice-machine and again tiny: they have the cheek to say double bed. This room was even smaller as it was now a shower only and not a three quarter bath with shower over. Back down stairs, same lengthy wait for: lifts, speak to staff, just what you want on a 3 night break! Finally get a room fit for purpose, total time spent 2hrs!! In summary, we were told: This is New York- the rooms are small! Tried food in Hotel: very poor, dirty eating area and rude staff. Mentioned coffee was cold at ‘The Box’ where purchase was made, told no it isn’t and that it was down to amount of milk added- I drink black coffee. There are plenty of restaurants, snack bars right outside hotel much nicer, cleaner and cheaper than City Kitchen. Guessing management will make their standard reply: “We look forward to hosting you again soon so we can share a more positive experience with you”. Summary: Poor rooms, staff, lift service, over charge for basic facilities (a gym(!) and wifi (what is this the Year 2000! )) and terrible food ",4/12/18,1
"Zac in the front desk made it a nice stay, great customer service, friendly and funny!! Made our stay in New York enjoyable from the first minute! He gave us recommendations on deals around and within the hotel ",4/11/18,5
"A very nice hotel located at the center of New York! Amazing service, love the lobby! The staffs are really nice and helpful! Especially Cesar! He was very helpful in helping us checking in and welcome us warmly! Will be back for sure! ",4/11/18,5
"I did not like the roon,to small, uncomfortable, no little refrigerators in the roon,the closet to small sorry but y no recommended this hotel to my friends, family and other peaple the only thing good is the place where the hotel i ",4/11/18,2
Great hotel location for travelers want the full Broadway experience. Friendly hotel staff and additional staff to help with the people and groups moving IN and OUT. Near a variety of great meal locations,4/11/18,5
"This hotel is in a great location and had price was good. Unfortunately no value. Super busy hotel and long waits for elevators. There is a lack customer service as the employees seem annoyed and overwhelmed and not willing to help out - when my key did not work on 2 occasions, I was told to go down and get my keys from the front desk - I was on the 20th floor and the elevators were always busy and it took them 4 minutes and 45 seconds to even pick up the phone at the front desk when I called. Rooms were dirty and severely run down as was the hotel...in need of major facelift ",4/11/18,3
"Great hotel ~ fun décor ~ lots of dining choices ~ large lobby area ~ easier to maneuver ~ super great location ~ we could walk to everything! It's a block from Times Square, many restaurants all over ",4/11/18,5
"excellent location, security, great choice of food, clean, pleasant staff. Would stay here again. The only miss leading thing was the pamphlet for the kitchen said they are open late and they were not especially on a Friday and Saturday night ",4/11/18,4
"Round the corner from Times Square. 2 Great places to eat at the hotel. Free WiFi, free printing - ideal for tickets and boarding passes. Suitable but basic rooms. Only down side - no towels in room when we arrived needed to ask twice for them. Then changed everyday. ",4/11/18,5
"You seriously can't beat the location and amazingness of this hotel. We stopped in only for a night but didn't want to leave! After traveling from Orlando by plane and riding the LIRR into Penn Station the ROW is only a few blocks north. Checked in quickly with Paola and Zac two great people who give a great first impression! (thanks so much you two). Got to our room which was spacious and had a great view overlooking 8th ave the river which we saw cruise ships in the morning. Made us sad to only be there one night but it was a short stay to catch a matinee on broadway. Will I stay here again?? As Big from SATC ""Ab-sofu*king-lutely"" ",4/10/18,5
Stayed here for two nights and loved everything about it. Times Square is literally maybe 2-3 blocks away and safe enough to go out at night for a walk around Times Square. Very convenient location and surrounded by many places to eat along with a lot of other great places to visit! Would 100% recommend staying at this amazing Hotel! :),4/10/18,4
This was one of my first trips to NYC and I found the hotel easily. I enjoyed staying there. The location was great. The room was clean and welcoming. Checking in and out was easy. The breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel was good also.,4/10/18,5
We came into town on Friday evening for a 2 night stay. Paola checked us in & graciously upgraded our rooms to double beds & a deluxe city view - without us even asking. You do not find this level of service at all hotels & it was greatly appreciated ! Rooms were clean & comfy. I personally was impressed with the promptness of the elevators every time we went to use them. No waiting ! The hotel’s location was extremely convenient & this made our stay in the city even more pleasant. Highly recommend & hope to visit this hotel again.,4/10/18,5
"Thank you very much to Robert, Latonya and Fernanda for a great welcome to NYC - just what our family needed after a day of travel. The view from our room is brilliant and it’s a relief we are so close to everything with the kid ",4/10/18,5
The hotel was located in the perfect spot right by time square. The room were incredible and the beds were so comfy :) the staff were great more than accomidating and the food in the resraurant was great with good prices as well as the italian restaurant bond also located in the restaurant :,4/10/18,5
Came in by bus for a theater weekend. Hotel is close to Port Authority and withinwalking distance to the theaters. Didn't have to use a cab all weekend. Deliciousbreakfast included in our package. Love that the City Kitchen (many different food booths) ispart of the hotel lobby.,4/10/18,5
"Hotel location excellent convenient to Times Square and broadway, food good, bedrooms clean and change of towels daily . Overall staff very helpful . However the Bar was disappointing and unfriendly and therefore only went once for short period . ",4/10/18,4
"My previous visit two years ago was excellent. This time, it was a very mixed experience. The first room they put me in had major damp in the walls (see pictures). When I drew this to the attention of the front desk, at first they didn't seem too concerned; then I showed them the pictures I'd taken for this review. That wasn't the only problem with the room; the window would only stay open if propped (someone had left an empty shampoo bottle holding the window open). There were other empty containers in the bathroom, and the wall behind the TV was badly damaged. On the good side, the hotel management tried hard to put things right, putting me in an upgraded room for the 2nd to 5th nights of my stay, and comping the first night. I definitely give them marks for that. However, the housekeeping service continued to be poor. One day my room was not cleaned, although I'd told the room server that I was leaving for the day. When I returned I called housekeeping and asked them to at least come up and empty the overflowing trash can. They didn't. I called again, with no response. I was walking out the door to take the trash down to reception (to make a point!) when I met a cleaner who emptied the trash for me. A similar story trying to get foam pillows - multiple calls to housekeeping. Overall, I think this hotel has gone down hill rapidly in terms of maintenance and in terms of service. It is no longer on my list for future NYC visits ",4/10/18,2
"When I arrived, Robert was very patient and helpful. He was very nice. Next morning, Juan Perez was great at the bar, he was so friendly and fun. The hotel is great, I had a small inconvenient with our bathroom because it wasn't very clean but Mr. Xavier acted very professionally and he invited us to a breakfast. These 3 guys, as well as the rest of the staff, were awesome ",4/10/18,4
We stay at this hotel about 2 nights and had a great time. Room was clean and tidy with nice view on 18th floor. Not only the hotel location is very good but staff also helpful and polite. I’ll be back again for sure!,4/10/18,5
"Nice hotel with the usual lazy and miserable staff. It's right in the middle of Times Square, Broadway and Hell's Kitchen restaurants. If you're willing to put up with the usual petty, miserable NYC staff with chips on their shoulders, go for it ",4/10/18,3
Robert was so friendly and helpful. He efficiently got us checked in and to our room. One of our guests has crutches due to a slipped disk in her back and he was so accommodating with her. Thanks Robert!,4/10/18,5
My boyfriend and I stayed in February - we got a good deal on the hotel and flights - or so we thought. On check-in we were informed of resort taxes - when we enquired what they were for we were told the gym and Wi-Fi. We needed neither but were told we had to pay - adding another $150 to our stay before we'd done anything. the room was functional and served our needs. Breakfast was included but due to till issues was quite chaotic some mornings - and they tried to charge us for at least one breakfast. Staff were fine but we didn't interact that much with them. A good base but just be aware of the taxes so they are not a nasty surpris,4/10/18,3
"the best thing is the location - very close to Times Square, lots of restaurants and takeways at 8th street and close to the subway. Very busy hotel and loud, but good if you only use the hotel for sleep anyway. ",4/10/18,4
"I remember this as the Milford Plaza and had no idea it had been made over. It was a steal of a price. Excellent location. Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff in a non intrusive way. The room was clean and while not a big huge update, enough to make it fantastic. ",4/9/18,4
"Fabulous location. Basic rooms provide a good base for exploring NYC. Many nice bars straight across the road from the hotel. We would recommend a meal at the View which is just round the corner, and a trip to Chelsea piers for a Hudson cruise. ",4/9/18,3
"For first time visitors in NYC this is the perfect hotel to stay at. Great location- nearby major city attractions. Only booked for the weekend and decided to book the rest of the week and Paola was very helpful and gave great service any time we had any questions. Thank you again, Paola, for all your help! ",4/9/18,5
"Arrived early hours of the morning and the check in staff Cristina t and paola were so helpful in sorting our rooms out, this really helped after flying from LA and being very tired - the hotel is on a great location and found it great to explore New York ",4/9/18,5
"I stayed here to catch couple of shows, and the location could not have been better. Loved the vibe and decor as well. But the room was dirty -shower, tub, sink full of dark hairs (there's no way a cleaner would have missed these) and overall surfaces in the room were dusty (so not a recent lapse of housekeeping). I checked in late and once I saw the status of the bathroom I went down and asked for a new room. Couldn't get one as the hotel was fully booked. Asked housekeeping to fix, got couple drink tickets and he said to remove the facility fee (~$30/night). Drinks were fine, but facility fee wasn't removed and the housekeepers idea of 'cleaning' was to pour bleach to the tub for the smell....didn't actually clean the hairs (disgusting) ",4/9/18,3
"Pros: modern hotel. Clean. Variety of dining options. Live music every night. Cons: Note: Staying in swanky NYC and paying this price, I had high expectations. Ran out of hot water in shower every day! Called to confirm microwave in room, upset to see there was not one upon arriving. Paid all expenses before arriving and was then charged a $68 fee upon arriving- was never told about this? Staff could be more helpful. ",4/9/18,3
"The ROW is amazing! Obviously location, but the price as well. It's a beautiful and clean hotel. Connections to public transportation right accross the street. The 1$ breakfast service is recommended, as breakfast in the immediate area can be somewhat expensive and not best quality. ",4/9/18,5
"Got recommended by friends and family to stay at row nyc,Robert the hotel associate greeted us with a smile and made us feel very welcome the first minute we step in to check in. He made sure we feel very welcome. Hotel staffs are awesome kept our room clean everyday and even surprised me with a birthday card and fruit platter. This trip is awesome cause we picked the right hotel. Highly recommended. The bathroom in room and lobby is very clean and that's a plus.and very convenient location to everything.we even book our tour to washington dc through them. thank you Robert and hotel staffs for making this trip very memorable. will totally booked again for our next trip ",4/9/18,5
"Everything was perfect. Tyler Dubs was great and very accomodating with my requests. The room was clean, comfortable and had a spectacular view. Check in was a breeze, service at breakfast was exceptional - what more could you ask for. Thank you, Tyler ",4/9/18,5
"Rooms extremely dated; furniture in poor condition. Rooms very dirty; bathroom had stained towels, stained pillow cases, torn sheets. Customer service is nonexistent here. Couldn’t reach a single staff member at hotel at 5 am because of party next to our room. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. There are so many other hotels in the area that are better quality. On a side note, beds were extremely comfortable. ",4/9/18,1
"I had positive interactions with every staff member there. Paolo really stood out at the front desk in the way she anticipated needs& problem solved with my check in & that of my errant son. Very professional and helpful from the front desk to the housekeeping staff. only drawback the decor & the concierge who stared into his phone all the time but otherwise, my weekend stay went off w/o a hitch. Thank ",4/9/18,5
"We were spending the weekend in the city to see two Broadway shows and ended up arriving four hours later than expected due to flight delays, being rerouted to a different airport, etc. Once we finally arrived at the hotel, we were greeted at check-in by Paola. The check-in process was very quick and easy. To make it even better, after our long day of schedule changes and flight delays, Paola kindly upgraded our rooms at no additional charge (without us even asking!). Rooms were clean and exceeded our expectations. We were very pleased with our first stay at this hotel and would stay here again when visiting NYC ",4/9/18,5
"After running into some trouble with an airbnb (which I will NEVER use again) I called into Row NYC to book a last minute room and they were more than accommodating. My boyfriend and I were in town for a broadway show. I've stayed with Row before and they are very consistent. Clean rooms, comfy beds, and a great location - just a block or so back from time square but noise isn't all that bad. My only complaint is value - the rooms are VERY small for the price you are paying, but that's NYC and you're most likely just using it for a crashpad anyways. Also the elevator system is totally annoying, but it's whatever. Row is my choice hotel in NYC ",4/9/18,4
"The hotel is great, accessible , and perfect rooms. The staff is also friendly, The receptionist Paola helped us with the check-in and gave us recommendations of where to go in NYC. I would recommend any one who is thinking of booking in this hotel to go ahead. By far the best ",4/8/18,5
Perfect location inside times square. Right across the street from iron bar who serves hookah at night and plays R&B music. This hotel is a bit snug but hey its NYC also be prepared to wait for elevator. i would definitely stay here again,4/8/18,5
"I really loved my room, very quiet and with an amazing view. Also I liked the reception, Zac was very polite and friendly. He gave me good recommendations and give me a first great impression of the Hotel. It is very very well located ",4/8/18,5
"We stayed for 3 nights at Row and loved this hotel! First off the location was absolutely perfect - so close to everything we wanted to do and see. Check in was a breeze, room was clean with a very comfortable bed. Breakfast was included in the deal we purchased and was great to start the day. I have zero complaints about this hotel, highly recommend it and will stay there again. ",4/8/18,5
Staff was very helpful and polite. Loved the room we were given  the view was amazing. It’s a busy hotel but quiet from our room. Love the food court and sweet shop attached to the hotel. Thank you for the complimentary fruit tray!!,4/8/18,4
"First impression, not enough people working the front desk, it was at least a 10 to 15 minute wait at all times of the day, they don't answer phone, after redailing the front desk 5 to 10 times I was told they are to busy to talk to ""guests"" The evelators are in adequit at all times of the day and night.The toilet is installed in a way that the space between the fron endge and the some bump out in the wall is not enough space for an average height man to sit on the toilet. side saddle is the only option but not too far because your other leg will hit the sink. Finally, the most outrageous behavior was the charge of 80 dollars to have a box delivered to my hotel room. I have stayed in hotels all over the world this is the first time I have have been charged for a delivery. When I looked over the hotel information that was in the room I found a notation that there was a nominal fee of 5 dollars for this service. I suppose in the overall scheme of staying here 5 bucks is not the end of the world; however when I pointed this out this out to one of the managers his response was to say that this information was out of date and that I should have researched this information on the internet because who in their right mind would assume that the information in your room would be relevant.My advice would be to stay far away from this tourist trap, run by a bunch of thieves ",4/8/18,1
We booked rooms with a city view and all we got was view of rooftop of the adjacent buildings.it was overpriced and the hallway were smelling awful. We booked 2 rooms and couldn’t wait to head out next Morning.,4/8/18,1
"I've stayed at Row NYC several times. It's my go-to hotel whenever I'm in New York. You won't find a better price point in Times Square and the location makes it easy to get anywhere you need/want to be in the city with ease.The customer service is also exceptional. Zac at the front desk recognizes me and always makes me feel welcome as a ""regular."" But everyone on staff are wonderful and friendly. We'll return again and again ",4/8/18,5
"We arrived late on Saturday evening, exhausted after a long flight and severe traffic coming into the city. Our check in was effortless and was assisted by the very friendly Paulo...she went out of her way to make us feel welcome, something I have not experienced at a city hotel before, and the fact that she upgarded our room and arranged a late checkout put the icing on the cake. Excellent service and well equipped hotel ",4/8/18,5
"The location is great, close to everything. Very friendly and helpful staff once you were at the front desk, but there was slow service due to long lines. We arrived in the middle of the night and when we got up to our room it wasn't cleaned. We got another room, but the cleanliness of this one was poor ",4/8/18,2
"Fantastic location close to all lines of the subway and walking distance to a lot of events and sightseeing and shopping areas. The hotel itself is very crowded, a lot of waiting for elevators and in the reception. Friendly staff once you got hold of one. The beds were fine, but the overall cleanliness was poor ",4/8/18,2
"Location was very accessible. Upon arrival, it was a very slow checkin. We tried to do the kiosk check in as I was told over email and it would not work, the employee we asked to help us was not helpful at all and was quite rude. ",4/7/18,3
"Check-in is was ok, but staff didn't smile and seemed put off with questions. When we went to the concierge desk upon arrival, it was closed, although in the evening the male staff was the best staff in the hotel, with a smile and willing to help us. The room had a nice feel and decor, but it was dusty!! The heater was on all times (broken), and when we turned the air on, it was noisy and it shot dust chunks/debris all over the floor. Location was great and we chose it for it and the competitive pricing. But the reason I would not recommend it is that we thought we were getting a good deal, but then was charged over $100 in 'fees', after pre-paying the rooms monthly in advance. ",4/7/18,3
I’ve stayed here for 10 years when I come to NYC even before it was the Row. It’s perfectly situated for the subway and EVERYTHING! If you get on their email list you get great discounts. Zac at the front desk is always at the ready with a welcoming smile and details on the latest and greatest in the area,4/7/18,4
"Nice hotel, great location, very busy atmosphere, blocks away from Times Square, delicious foods on 1st floor, staff very friendly and cute, only complaint was valet parking....$70 & 45 mins to bring me my ca ",4/7/18,4
"PROS:Location - Hotel was in a great location, walking distance to Times Square & loads of other sights, shops, bars and restaurants. Rooms - Very small but it's NYC, you're not there to sit in your room! Bed was comfy. Don't expect a view though. We directly faced a brick wall. CONS:Water - The water rain brown for half a day. We had to ring to staff to ask what to do. There should've been a sign up or staff should have offered bottled water to drink. Resort fee - Pretty expensive at $30 per day considering it only really gave you wi-fi. Breakfast - Again, expensive at $8 per day. Was only one small pastry, piece of fruit & drink ",4/7/18,4
"Great location for time square but other than that I don’t recommend, they need a new cleaning staff, I don’t mind giving credit when credit is due, the room was dusty the bed was terrible the bath tub had ring around it, I left my cleaning supplies so they would get the hint to clean u ",4/7/18,2
"Good points location,Bath and sink clean and our room are back ofhotel and quiet and bar in hotel. Bad points rooms cold despite heating but max is 26.5, quilts paper thin so having to wear jumper to bed. Rooms small, very tired furniture almost falling apart. Rooms very clinical looking Bath drain slowly in emptying which is strange as we are high up. Lobby of hotel very busy. Hot water Luke warm Receptionist did not make me feel welcoming. Did not get her name. To be told that I can’t have my room until my credit card clears did not go down well. What has pushed me to write this review is the door of the bathroom slides so cleaners would not see this unless they close door over - the door on inside is dirty even blood on the door. Remote to tv needs a clean and I dare not look any further as worried what else I will find!! This review incidentally not aimed at staff but management if hotel. At time of writing I am still staying at hotel as had to pay upfront. So looking forward to seeing Mangers comments re above. Btw won’t be staying here again so saying changes will be made in time for my next not acceptable. You should have got it right first time!!! ",4/7/18,2
"Fantastic so far after having a not so good day Zac on duty was fantastic and extremely helpful, our room was upgraded at no extra cost. I would recommend this hotel I’m traveling with my 14 year old son ",4/7/18,5
"Aside from the location being perfect, Cristina T in the front desk was friendly and pleasing. Will definitely recommend this hotel to friends... The lively music in the lobby just made us smile , after a long and trip from Washington DC.. ",4/6/18,5
The row is a great place to say. As soon as we walked in we thought the vibe was cool and were impressed from the start. When we checked in a super nice guy named Cesar helped us out and even upgraded our room for free. Highly recommended,4/6/18,5
Cesar at the front desk showed us a great welcoming to the hotel and hooked us up with everything. Great man. Thanks Cesar. Our room was nice. It had a decent view of 8th. Would recommend anyone to stop in and enjoy the atmosphere along with the friendly people,4/6/18,5
"I give thanks to Cesar, he checked me in as quickly as he could after standing in a rather long line for about 10 minutes. The room is absolutely nice and modern, which I love. The mattress is amazing, I know I’m going to sleep good for the next two days. Thanks Dere ",4/6/18,5

What a pleasure to check in with such a vibrant personality! (Junior). He made it worth the trip after having sat in traffic for two hours! The room was clean and perfect for our stay. Will definitely consider staying here again,4/6/18,5
"First, i will praise the recepcionist called Junior, that is the best i ever have met, cause he gaves to us tottally attention, was very lovely and deserv all the respect. Me and my husband will return to the Row NYC Hotel because of him. Including make our chek-in and the ckeck-out, and we paid the total and even the late check-out. Occurs that, when we arrived in Brazil, I received a message that let me very worried, a message from the credit card informing a purchase in the amount of R$ 231,17, after we have paid and maked the chek-out ",4/6/18,5

"Very central location... close to great shopping, shows, Times Square, and lots of restaurants. Very warm welcome at check in from Ceasar. He went out of his way to help us. Super clean, modern rooms with updated bathroom. We will definitely look to stay here again ",4/5/18,5
"This was an absolutely perfect location for a theatre trip! I had stayed at the property for a business trip previously, and I changed my family trip plans in order to stay at The Row again because of the location, the quality of the hotel, and the yummy food options. ",4/5/18,4
"Quality stay in a fantastic location hotel. Special mention to our now Good Friend Junior who made our stay exceptional, when we come back it will be to this hotel and mainly because of Junior. ROW NYC make sure you promote or do what you can to keep Junior he is an asset to your Hotel. ",4/5/18,5
"NYC Row is around the corner from Times Square, within walking distance to a show, close to a subway stop and the hop-on-hop-off tours, and plenty of food choices everywhere! The staff is helpful and so friendly. District M - think food court, but high-end - is great. Conveniently located in the hotel. And my daughters loved The Sugar Factory. I suggest getting a milkshake! We had a room with two beds and a view of 8th ave. This is our 2nd stay. If we go back, I want to stay there again ",4/5/18,5
"Our hotel associate, Cesar, was very helpful and attentive upon checkin! He's a great asset to the hotel! We came for my daughters 17th birthday and got a room with a BEAUTIFUL city view! We were also told by Cesar that my daughter might recurve a little something for her birthday! I would recommend this hotel to everyone ",4/5/18,5

"On arrival at check-in, Cesar was very quick to get me settled. The location is close to the Theatre district, restaurants, and the Port Authority with buses and trains which suited me perfectly. Shopping is nearby in all directions ",4/5/18,4
"Stayed here for 3 nights. On arrival we queued over 40 minutes to check in. Rooms weren't ready so we queued again to leave luggage with concierge. Later queued to recover luggage and queued again to get our rooms. Queued for the lift only to find room I had been given was still occupied. Queued for lift again, got room changed and queued for lift again. Over three days we must have spend at least a full half day in queues. Room was adequate, clean and more spacious than I would expect in New York but air conditioning was incredibly noisy. Corridors and reception area very dimly lit and unwelcoming. We chose not to eat in the hotel. Would only stay again if desperate. ",4/5/18,2
"The location of this hotel is about the only good thing. When we arrived and checked in we headed to our room, after having a nosey around the VERY cramped room I discovered a USED condom in the bedside table… following this discovery I headed down to reception and complained. I spoke to the manager who apologised and deducted some city tax. We were moved to another room. Once we arrived at the new room we left our stuff and headed out. The rooms are small and clean to an extent. There is a hair dryer provided however I found that my UK straighteners didn’t work. On our first night we were very tired however the room next door insisted on playing rap music VERY loud and smoking weed – it took me to complain 3 times before this was resolved. Six nights later we checked out of the room and headed to the airport. On the coach to the airport I discovered that my Dr Dre Beats headphones weren’t in my bag – they hadn’t been removed for the whole duration of the trip. On arrival at the airport I approached a security guard who kindly let me borrow his mobile phone to contact the hotel. I was advised to send an email. On arrival back home to the UK I sent an email explaining what had happened in regards to my headphones. Following several emails back and forth I had made it clear that my head phones were placed in my bag on the plane and not removed for the duration of the trip – they were stored in a zipped bag on the chair. I believe they were stolen. Following an investigation which involved checking entry to the room and questioning housekeeping staff – I was offered a reimbursement for my item. This leads me to believe they were stolen - however they werent going to admit to it. I’m a very grateful that I got some sort of reimbursement even if it was half the cost of the item. If you are booked or planning to book ROW NYC please ensure that all valuable items are stored in the safe otherwise avoid this hotel!! Housekeeping/hotel staff cannot be trusted ",4/5/18,1
"I recently stayed at the Row for 6 nights (with a break in between) and found the hotel to be very good value -- even though the room is very basic and small. The first 3 nights I had a larger room, however when I returned for the remaining 3 nights they gave me a very small room, as I was on my own it was sufficient but would have been a squeeze if there were two guests. Though simple, the room was clean and had all the amenities needed. It is in an excellent location - in walking distance to almost anywhere in the center. Even though the hotel is extremely busy, I found check-in to be efficient, and would like to thank Zac at reception for welcoming me and offering professional and informative service at all times. I would definitely consider returning to this hotel if price is competitive ",4/4/18,3
"If you need sales assistance, look for Mrs. ELIANE MATAMOROS. She is the best accounting/sales support. It was the best experience I've ever had with a hotel support. I recomend NYC ROW Hotel. She answer quickly and correclty. Thanks Eliane ",4/4/18,5
"Rooms were all so noisy, because of the air condition system at the upper floors, or the traffic noise at the lowest ones. We try three different, kindly offered by the employees at the reception desk (that was the best part of the hotel). The rooms are also dirty, the worst of it was the bathroom where I had to clean by myself hair from other hostages from the bathtub courtain. There's another disgusting point on the service fee. You will have to pay 32$ per night according to these service fee, but you won't get informed that this includes discounts at the breakfast stores inside the hotel and at some stores of souvenirs on the outside. They'll tell you that includes free calls (international also) filtered water (you'll have tap water in the room) and... wi-fi! (so it's not free, you are paying for it).Disappointing ",4/4/18,2
"Great location, great value for money and great facilities. Especially the City Kitchen with the various styles of food available. The bar staff in District M, in particular Jarret and Zack. Top guys - thank you ",4/4/18,5
Lovely central clean and modern hotel with helpful staff! Highly recommend it! junior’who checked me in on arrival was very helpful! Ive stayed here 3 times with no issues anytine jgs the perfect hotel for value location and quality,4/4/18,5
Price is valuable. room according two bed need more space. room dont have any relax or nice pics. usuallg every Hotel does. Bathroom comod was very low. specially little weight people is very difficult. Even normal people will feel ocouard,4/4/18,3
I would stay here again as you are in the center of everything!!! Walking distance to anything you need and great views from our room! (2609). We had a corner room that had multiple windows so we were able to look at different areas,4/4/18,5
"This was our first time staying at Row NYC and at first we were hesitant because we could not reach the hotel by telephone to let them know of our late arrival. We were on the phone for 30 minutes listening to ""club"" music. No one ever picked up the phone. We used Facebook and Twitter to reach the hotel. No luck. We ended up calling the reservation center and they called the hotel for us. When we got to the hotel, the front desk person was not very pleasant. She seemed annoyed to be at work and was not friendly at all, which was disappointing. The room was very small but the temperature was very comfortable. Our room faced 8th Avenue and it was incredibly noisy with the sirens blaring on the first night. So if you don't like noise, this is not the hotel for you. The single beds were amazingly comfortable! We were surprised. There were enough plugs for devices and such, which was a plus. The bathrooms were clean and tended to daily. The hotel felt very safe with staff monitoring the elevators. The elevators were cool in that you were assigned a particular elevator depending on the floor you were staying. We would be willing to stay at Row NYC again. It's in a great location being in the center of everything and it felt very safe. Aside from the front desk person, the rest of the staff was pleasant and friendly. Next time we will not stay in a room near the elevators. Other guests were so incredibly noisy and inconsiderate of other guests still sleeping ",4/3/18,4
"We enjoyed our time at The Row, and we will definitely stay again. It is so close to everything - food, shops, subway, and shows. The atmosphere of the hotel and surrounding area helped us to enjoy our extended weekend. ",4/3/18,5
Decent hotel but rooms are very tight and when you add in the high daily resort fee you can likely get better at this price... especially when you’re only getting 1 ply (or cheap) toilet paper and you’re stunning your toe moving around the tiny bathroom. Clean and comfortable but shop around first.,4/3/18,3
"The room was dirty, it smelled bad and there were hairs all over the place. The shower was dirty and had stains. The hotel is super crowed and there is no security. They charge you for “resort fees” yet they dont provide what they’re supposed to. ",4/3/18,1
"In the course of my business career staying at nationally branded hotels was common for me. Since my retirement I have been able to stay at less well known hotels. This led me, based on a friend's recommendation, to the Row NYC. Fro. The moment we arrived it was clear that this hotel would be at the top of our list of ""customer service oriented"" hotels.Our first and defining interaction with the hotel staf was with Zac at the front desk. Zac made sure that we were comfortable while we waited for our room to be readied. The he sought us out when the he room was ready and completed our check in. While Zac had set the service bar high, every other staff member met that same level of service.Now about the property itself. For our taste the ROW is ideally situated in the heart of the theater district. Every show is in an easy walking or taxi ride distance. There are some great local restaurants that are as reasonably priced as you will find in that area.The rooms were very clean and all amenities were available. Our room was as quiet as could beconsidering it is NY and we were on the 27th floor. Check in and check out were a breeze. We are already looking forward to our next trip to the city thanks in large part to knowing where we will stay ",4/3/18,5
"The bar staff, brendan and jarrett are so much fun to chat with. Very knowledgeable with things to do in the area. Extremely helpful and make the best drinks! I enjoyed my stay at row NYC and would highly reccommen ",4/3/18,5
I liked it.The guys at front desk were nice and helpful the rooms were clean not noisy at all the bed and pillows were perfect for me. They changed the bed linen every day. We had a deluxe and a premium room. The premium room was bigger it was a corner room with city view. The size of deluxe room was just ok I can imagine lthat the standard rooms mite be too small for two people. I would recommend to put in the rooms like Premium and deluxe a mini bar or coffee maker or a bottle of water for the exhausted guests /however the tap water was pretty good too/. It's not a big deal but it makes you feel better. The breakfast served in the bar is rather poorer and expensive I would recommend to go one floor up and there are 5 restaurants and the two of them serve breakfast too that's that's much better. Subway station Times Square and Central Park are pretty close so the location is great. WiFi connection was super.,4/3/18,4
The hotel is located in a convenient part of the city with several attractions in walking distance. The lobby was a great place to sit and enjoy a coffee or a drink. There was also a great place to enjoy a meal without leaving the hotel.,4/2/18,4
"Staff were brilliant , food in the hotel was expensive but really good. Bar staff were ace and full of information. This hotel is in the best location for exploring. Room was spot on with a great city. Clean and tidied everyday .We would definitely stay again and recommend it highly. ",4/2/18,5
"First room was far from second room and it was very tiny, with no space for a bag. Often lifts took too much time and they were very crowed. Once had to go down from10 floor to 1st floor through the stairs, poor breakfast with limited options. Room service poor - one day shower towels missed. ",4/2/18,2
"We enjoyed our stay at ROW. Great location near to Times Square. The room was basic, clean and comfortable. Would stay again. We had a great view of 8th Avenue from the 128th floor. Did not use the facilities so cannot comment too busy sightseeing ",4/2/18,3
"Overall, it was a good time. Came into the city for the night for a concert. Very friendly and informative staff. Clean room and bathroom. The only weird thing was the tub in the shower. A Bathfitters-Gone-Wrong kind of situation. ",4/2/18,4
"Our stay was great, the room was just the right size. The location of the hotel was perfect, it has a subway station nearby, time square at just 10 minutes (walking distance), the staff of the hotel so nic ",4/1/18,5
"Got to the hotel after travelling all the way from Manchester all through the night, went to check in and there was already a queue of roughly 55-60ish guests trying to check in with only two receptionists on the desk... we were waiting to check in for about 2 hours. Once we finally got to the desk the man who checked us in seemed very rude and impolite as if we weren't valued customers. Once we got up to our room we then discovered we couldn't get in as the key didn't work, we then went back downstairs to the concierge desk to get it re programmed to then be told that we would have to wait as nobody could see to us... all we wanted was for them to re-programme it which would have took literally 10 seconds (I know because I was a hotel receptionist for 3 years). After waiting for another half an hour for someone to show up they finally sorted us out, no apology given. We finally got into our room roughly 3-3.5 hours after arriving and the room was stunning, very clean,comfortable and we had the best view. I understand this is a very busy hotel in the centre of Manhattan and a 5 minute walk away from times square but they need to put customers first. Maybe a little bit more training and 2 or 3 extra receptionists on the desk would be very beneficial. All in all we had the best trip apart from this issue, we will be returning back to New York for a 3rd time but not to this hotel ",4/1/18,4
"It was conveniently located at Times Square. But if you don’t need to be in the very center it is unnecessarily noisy and crowded. I wish i had picked a mid town hotel. It was extremely crowded. The receptionists and particularly the bartenders were extremely uncooperative and rude. The room i booked was sold out and as a consolation i was given a superior room but it was a simple room. The bartenders humiliated me twice for asking for information. The room service woke me up in the mornings to ask whether i need towels. One needs a different kind of literacy to survive in that hotel. There were only six elevators for almost hundreds of people for every ride and thus the access to the rooms was extremely difficult. One has to learn to use the elevators because they don’t function by simply hitting the button. You need to write passcodes to operate them. I kept waiting for simple and easy things in other hotels. For example, i had to wait for an hour to get an access to my luggages when i checked out. The room was poorly furnished for a four star hotel. Let alone the refrigerator or a simple console table, there were no glass glasses. There was no refrigerator or water heater or hair dryer. And the air conditioning was the worst. It worked as if there were a drilling machine inside the room. It was impossible to sleep so i turned it off. But this time it was cold. I don’t understand why booking com rate this hotel as a luxury deal because it is barely a three star hotel ",4/1/18,2
"Great location for theater, dining and sightseeing. Excellent and very helpful staff. City Kitchen was ideal for dining with a great variety. Best hamburger I've had anywhere. Valet parking package was definitely worth it ",3/31/18,5
"What a dump! The lobby deceives you into believing your room with be decent, even nice, don’t fall for it. These rooms are filthy! The paint is chipping off the walls and base boards, the bathroom is just gross. There is NO excuse for filth. ",3/31/18,1
"Great front desk folks - Junior was super helpful and accommodating! Lobby is fun and hip. Small rooms, but perfectly acceptable. Right in the heart of the Theatre District - so it's crowded, but....NYC. I'd stay here again ",3/31/18,4
Cesar is the best. He gave us an upgraded room. The room had an amazing view. I’m here for one night and it was a great experience. It is in the most perfect area in Times Square. Highly recommend this hotel.,3/31/18,5
"Coming in from a long day of competing and traveling, when we drove up to the Row NYC, the valet was so nice and very quick to help us with our car. Additionally, the line to check-in was very short. Our new friend at the front desk Zac was very kind and genuinely interested in our reason for traveling and learning more about our weekend plans. He also upgraded us to a suite, which was very kind, and we didn't even have to ask! Then, when we got to the room, it was very clean, and overall the hotel is easy to navigate, and there are a fair number of elevators, so it didn't take too long to get to our room ",3/31/18,5
"Location was excellent and safe. Staff were friendly and kind. Convenient breakfast food downstairs (good coffee, bagels, donuts etc). Room was small, but on par for NYC. Would definitely stay there again (if the price fits) ",3/31/18,4
"We have stayed at the Row many times. Steps away are Broadway theatres and amazing restaurants! The hotel is unique, comfortable, & clean. Other hotels are double the price or higher! When my husband was out of the country, my teenage daughter and I were at the Row last summer for a 4 day trip when a hurricane hit our own city. We could not get home for 10 days. The staff at Row NYC went out of their way to accomodate us and make us feel safe and cared for. They turned a very stressful time into a great 2 week vacation! Now THAT is service ",3/31/18,5
"How often do you leave a front desk and come away feeling this hotel should be great experience? At The Row with Cathy and Cesar at check in and check out you have a great team that answers questions with focused attention, gets you in and out quickly and let's you know you are welcome. The room choices, rates and offers are very attractive. Large lobby ""population"" doesn't affect access to room, good restaurant or to subway ",3/31/18,5
Enjoyed our stay on the hotel. Junior was wonderful. Professional and Courteous. Great location to all major areas in Manhattan. Walking distance to Time Square. Friendly staff. Would stay at hotel next time we visit NY,3/31/18,5
"After having stayed at another hotel in Times Square the previous few nights we transferred to ROW NYC for the last night of the trip. Terrible experience from check in, where it took over 45 minutes to check in on an admittedly busy day, to the offer to send bags up from luggage check where we had previously left them. From 1:30 to 4 :30 the bags never arrived. Finally went down and had to get them myself. Karina offered a partial refund which I never received despite phone call to her later in week. Thermostat nonfunctional, room hot. Lukewarm shower ",3/31/18,1
"Great location to see all main attractions and close to metro. Rooms too small for families - you cant open suitcase! Showers slow and not great either. I stayed at the hotel before with just my partner and it was fine. Junior was particular helpful to us as we had to move rooms twice - he found a resolution when others couldnt. Facilities nice, modern and clean. Located right in centre of things and although so noisy outside you cannot hear alot from room. ",3/31/18,3
Everything about my trip was remarkable! I would for sure stay again and hopefully longer next time. There is so much to do in the hotel alone. Everything looks beautiful and chic! The staff was extremely helpful and kind!,3/30/18,5
"At 1st sight we are frightened: lobby so crowded, our room was too narrow, but it’s been recently renovated: very clean, bedlinen, a safe box, an iron , and hair dryer! Elevators are completely computerized! And Cesar was extremely efficient, patient , and cleared all doubts we had! We strongly recommend this hotel! Orlando e Marina São Paulo, Brazi ",3/30/18,5
"Cesar was great at the front desk , got us in very quick and was very respectful. definitely staying here again. the room was exactly what we expected and more , we got upgraded and we couldnt of been happier with what we got , i love new york city and Canadians. i looked at other hotels and this waa by far the best choice . ",3/30/18,5
They should hire more people to work on the staff. The cleaning was not good. The breakfast is little. They charge for services that one does not use. The phones do not work. The staff is not friendly,3/30/18,1
"Great place to stay when theater going. Clean rooms, efficient staff as long as you remember you are in the midst of Times Square and the noise comes along with it, you will have a pleasant stay. Fitness center, clean and has everything you need for a quick workout. ",3/30/18,4
"Great hotel, lovely people, expecialy Junior, he was so helpful and kind with a good sense of humour, made our arrival extra special. Clean room, clean bathroom and it’s smells Devine In here haha Will be back to stay here for sureLouise  ",3/29/18,5
"Tiny room, charge for delivery, staff without expression, has no advantage over other hotels, they charge for services that should be free of charge for the price of the hotel, since what they offer does not add value to the stay ",3/28/18,2
We enjoy Broadway shows and this is the perfect location for this! Most of the shows we saw were within 2 blocks of the hotel. It is very accessible to the subways as well. City Bakery in the hotel has a great selection of food too,3/28/18,5
"I really appreciate Marcelo and Kathy excellent staff , very professional on treating guest. Excellent hotel, Front desk staff is very friendly and welcoming. The hotel layout is good , especially the main entrance very nice ",3/28/18,5
"From the great people at check-in and check-out, to the great room, to the perfect location, I couldn't be more pleased with yet annother stay. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it ",3/28/18,5
"What can I say....New York left us breathless! The Row was modern but small. Clean but small rooms. Service is great. No coffee or tea making facilities in the hotel which was a negative. Starbucks, McDonalds, shakeshack, juniors all around the corner. Perfectly located in Broadway. Walking distance from almost anywhere...We stayed 4 nights and it just was not enough! Hop on hop off buses close by. Time square close by. You're literally in Broadway. Very busy lobby area. Seems like every day there was an event taking place. Aircon works. Bathroom small but clean. Shower is in the bath tub but to step in and out is easy as they've made it higher/lower to get in /out easier. Restaurant was busy all the time but we didn't eat there. Over all a good stay. Lifts were quick. Passages were clean but dark. ",3/27/18,4
"One of the worst NYC hotels!!!! Staff on reception obnoxious, single rooms next to the, not one, but three huge ventilation rolls, which makes room vibrate like you would be sleeping in the old steam engine boat, literally inside the engine deck! As one reviewer wrote below, imma copy paste: ""Bottom line, I do NOT recommend this property and will not be returning. ",3/27/18,1
"Other than a small room everything was great.My son and daughter loved the soft beds. We got clean towels everyday. The location was close to stores,theaters and attractions. We walked everyware while our car was safly parked . ",3/27/18,4
great hotel and loved he central location to time square! Had a burst pipe under our bathtub causing the tub floor to be squishy and have a horrible raw sewer stench! Rooms are very small but comfortable beds!,3/27/18,4
"At first glance, you would think ROW is a nice place to stay. But once you take a deeper look, you'll realize that the Service, quality, and room? all terrible. After my 30 minute stay, I was forced to wait another 30 minutes for the supervisor to arrive in the lobby. When she did, she brought along her attitude and rudeness and immediately told me my payment is nonrefundable, and that I will have to go through the Reservations team for any refunds. 3 days later, I'm still trying to get in touch with the Reservations team ",3/27/18,2
"Central hotel, good breakfast area. A more welcome greeting on arrival - customers should not be left waiting on rooms especially having been travelling all day. Communicate and keep customers informed. Ensure that the reception desk has enough staff at all times to deal with the customers. ",3/27/18,3
This hotel isn’t 4 Star in my opinion. There are unclear facilities charges and it needs an overhaul. Staff are friendly and it does a job but I wouldn’t recommend or stay again. Room only with no tea and coffee facilities not really what you expect for how the hotel is marketed or billed.,3/27/18,2
We stayed at the hotel for 5 days and the staff were great! Kubus who was at reception when we checked in was so friendly and gave us two free breakfasts each! The hotel is in a great location minutes away from Times Square! The view of the whole of New York was incredible from our window and the room was great :),3/27/18,5
The hotel had been a fantastic start to our trip to NYC and it is in a great location! Reasonable price and clean rooms as well as accommodating staff. Will be returning here again at the end of the year,3/26/18,5
Needed somewhere to sleep for a night in business trip to New York and thankfully found Row NYK. Pricing was excellent and the room near and clean. The added service of baggage storage prior to check in as well as after check out is a welcome bonus for the business traveler. Close to Times Square Station with easy access to downtown. Plenty of eating places near by. Will definitely return,3/26/18,5
"Best trip of my life, and this hotel played a big role in my experience. Everything is within walking distance, Times Square, Madison Squares Garden, Central Park, Broadway, Grand Central Station, just to name a few. Enjoy! ",3/26/18,5
"The hotel was extremely busy and this wasn't even in season. But the staff cope remarkably well. The reception desk would either be packed with people coming in or quiet during a lull - so my advice would be if you ever need the reception use the phone or go when there's a lull.The standard rooms I know are small but we were extremely pleased to be given an upgrade free of charge to a superior room because the receptionist noticed we were there for my wife's 50th birthday. This was a wonderful gesture - and not only that they brought up a fruit basket and a bottle of Prosecco on the house as well. This superior room by the way was superb. Big enough with wonderful view over Times square. (Now I know that the standard rooms are smaller, but all I can say is remember that you only sleep, wash, and dress in the room - after all this is New York and you should be out on the town! )The hotel also has a bar - which is also very busy and has live music regularly - and a restaurant. We didn't use the restaurant because we were always out, but often used the bar upon our return and at breakfast, and the prices were reasonable for the area.You will not find a hotel - particularly in this price range - better situated. You are so close to Times Square that you are for all intents and purposes on the Square. Also you are only 12 blocks ( a 15 minute walk) from Penn Station and a direct link to Newark airport.) Less than 12 blocks to Central Park ( a 10 minute walk) and so easy to navigate from and to places.One thing that did take us by surprise, but never staying in New York before I don't know if this is the 'norm' - there aren't any tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms - BUT - ALL the more chance for us to drink the splendid New York coffee.We will be back ",3/26/18,5
"Perfect location! Rooms are small but functional. You do hear street noise, but it was worth it for the corner room we got with views of the streets, theatres, and highrises. Fun vibe to bring my older teenager for a week in the city ",3/26/18,5
"A huge hotel if a little impersonal. The room was on the small side but came well equipped. Phone, WiFi, TV. safe, hairdryer, iron etc, although no fridge or kettle. Good cleaning service. Fast lifts (I was on the 20th floor) and very quiet. Perfectly located for Times Square and Broadway. I would recommend it ",3/26/18,4
"This hotel is in a prime location for all the major tourist attractions and opposite shake shack, however that’s the only positive comment I have.The hotel on the face of it looks great, however when you look closer it is grubby and extremely dated. Every time you would use the lift you would get an electric shock now matter what floor you were on, probably not the safest.The first room was apparently an “upgrade” so I dread to think what the standard of our original room was like.The room was awful, small, dated, stains all over the carpet wall paper peeling from the walls and hair in the sink. We immediately went back to reception and were told they would move us in the morning as the hotel was full.The walls were paper thin, we could hear everything our drunken neighbours were talking about at 0500.We moved rooms to an “upgraded” room again. Although on a higher floor the room was slightly better (wall paper intact) but it was a lot smaller, the bathroom size was ridiculous. We stayed in that room as we didn’t want the inconvenience of moving to a third room.At 0200 on our last evening we received an invoice under the door regarding the resort fee. When we checked in we were advised everything had been paid for, so receiving a $130+ bill was not great. Especially was the amenities did not warrant the fee itself.My partner disputed this and they kindly knocked a day off as we were not happy with either of the rooms. The rude receptionist advised that we should have raised this again, however moving to a 3rd room is ridiculous they should get it right first time. The hotel is huge so you’re treated as a number and not a guest. Nothing personal about the experience.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC ",3/26/18,1
I am always thrilled to stay at The Row. It is so centric and practical. Service is always good. Looking forward to go back any time. Location! Location! Location! And great service. The Row is at the heart of Broadway.,3/26/18,5
"The Row has a nice urban vibe which corrispondes exactly with your expectations of busy Manhattan lifestyle.The rooms are small but cosy.The best part of the hotel is though the bar; great music, good service and great staff. A special thanks to Josie for an unforgettable service. Will be back ",3/26/18,5
"Excellent location, comfortable and more than enough to rest, sleep and shower. Overall hygiene is ok, but could be a bit more accurate. Very nice smell at the entrance, good elevator service, helpfull staff ",3/25/18,4
We came here on a deal. Location is excellent: near Penn Station & the theatre district Request a room on a higher floor. Cesar on the front desk took pity on a 6’9” man and gave me a king size bed. The shower was tall enough for me. I could even see my face in the mirror.All the employees were very helpful and cheerful. Concierge was able to direct us to a close urgent care. We will probably come back here again,3/25/18,4
The hotel is in an excellent location. Soo close to Times Square and all Manhattan has to offer. Staff were very friendly and helpful and excellent at their jobs. Certainly will be back to stay and definately recommend it to anyone,3/25/18,4
"I stayed here with my brother as we were celebrating our birthdays in New York. I can not stress enough to others that I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Though in a decent location and has a somewhat modern lobby the same can’t be said for their rooms. We stayed in a city view twin for 5 days and we’re incredibly disappointed with the standard of the room. This hotel is very dated and needs a serious face lift, the whole interior of the rooms are quite old and the paint job is terrible. The staff are far from professional at the front desk counters and have no idea on how to provide quality or efficient customer service, instead their abrupt and rude. We were checked in by a staff member named Christina who was quite rude yet had the audacity to ask us to provide her with a 5 star rating on trip advisor which would reward her with free lunch. Not only was I shocked but disgusted in her request. The female staff member who checked us out was incredibly rude especially when I brought to her attention a discrepancy with my account. Instead of focusing on what benefits the staff maybe concentrate on accommodating your guests first. The shower was horrible, can you imagine being in NY on holiday it’s minus 1 degree and your stuck with a shower that barely pumps water and the hot water is far from anything close to hot. This is clearly a budget hotel with very low standards when it comes to service and cleanliness.! I recommend people pay that little bit extra and stay at the Intercontinental across the road or anywhere else that actually is a decent hotel ",3/25/18,1
"The ROW is in a magnificent location. However, it is by no means a 5* hotel as described on booking.com and potentially other sites. It's 3* at most. - The elevators are horrendous. At certain times of the day you have to wait for ages to even get in a lift. - The hotel is very grubby in general. Dirt in the elevators and hallways. Besides this the entertainment they occasionally have in the bar is nice ",3/25/18,3
"During the last Nor'easter, we found our flights cancelled the day we were to leave. Of course my main concern was what if the hotel was booked? Where would we stay? The staff could not have been more friendly, sympathetic, or proactive in finding us an additional two nights lodging...at the same cost! Who does that? ",3/25/18,5
"the persons on front desk have not attended well, I still expect to return in my next trip to ny. I was in room 1631 (I guess). There was strange noise like somedone with hammer hiting piping. I really appreciated the quick action in moving me to room 2703 ",3/25/18,4
"Loved the hotel. Stayed for one night and it didn't disappoint. Normal NYC size rooms. Easy check in, loved the pizza at the bar. Evening vibe in the bar was great. Didn't have to go out as the weather was crappy. Would stay here in a heartbeat ",3/25/18,5
"Cesar checked me in and made sure to get us a great room that would fit our needs. Wonderful Front desk Attendant. We have stayed here many times, and the hotel is always clean and well maintained. Great service and better prices than other hotels in the area. Close to many popular Broadway theaters, as well as times square. ",3/25/18,5
"The reception from junior was amazing, first impressions count and you certainly made a fantastic one with us. He upgraded our room and found out it was birthday and placed a bottle of wine in the bedroom while we where out.Our room was clean and tidy.A big thanks for the recommendation of Virgil’s BBQ grill the restaurant was outstanding and went above an beyond our expectations. Also great location and close to allot of places. Keep up the great work Junior. ThanksGemma and Jo ",3/24/18,5
"The location of this hotel is right in the heart of the city. The area is always busy which adds another level of safety to the whole experience, especially at night and for people unfamiliar with the city. The check-in and check-out was surprisingly quick and the room was quiet. Everything was very clean and although it wasn't the most spacious room, it definitely did what it had to do, and considering this is New York City, i'd say the size was pretty good. One of my favorite parts about this hotel was the 3 rewards that came with it. The free shuttle bus was a great perk to add on for my experience ",3/24/18,5
"The location is great, that’s about it :( The staff were rude and unpleasant. The hotel rooms are exceptionally small, even for NYC standards. The cafe prices were very high. The floors of the hotel were so uncomfortably hot. Rooms were dirty ",3/24/18,2
"First time staying at Row NYC. Had a pleasant experience overall. Booked on Hotel Tonigjt for a really great deal. Walked from Port Authority to hotel. Looks nice from the outside, inside is modern and trendy. I liked it. Check in line was too long so I used the self check in kiosk, kinda cool. Not a fan of the daily resort fee. They give you a collapsible water bottle to use at water stations which is on every other floor. Elevator is interesting but I appreciate the safety, and how quickly they operate. Drinks at District M were overpriced. Rooms are tiny but perfect for one or two. Internet was okay, could be better. Walls were a little thin, could hear others in the next room. Heater in my room startled me every time it turned on. Could not hear any outside noise which was good. Staff was wonderful, like that they store your luggage after you check out, in case your flight is later or something. I’d stay here again. Sorry for the rant/ramble! ",3/24/18,3
"So glad me and my partner stumbled across this hotel. With my partner being 19 and me being 17 we had to find a hotel which allowed the check in age to be 18. (It is common in NewYork hotels for the check in age to be 21, so if you are a young couple, this hotel is definitely the place to be. This was the perfect place to settle for our 6 day trip to the big Apple. Central, lively, you get the whole taste of NewYork from even just being in the hotel. The staff are very kind, patient and caring and treat you like family. Especially Cesor, who was so helpful and accommodating and made us feel incredibly welcome in our first trip to the best city ever. So if you are thinking of choosing this edgy, entertaining and relaxing hotel, I’d definitely say go for it. You will not regret it and for sure me and my partner will be coming back to NYC and this hotel. ",3/24/18,5
"The good bits, it is very well placed with easy access to all New York has to offer. It is a very big, noisy hotel. The elevator system takes a bit of getting used to and was a bit of a scramble at times.The toiletries were good quality. The room was small but too warm for my liking. The bed was comfortable. The staff were friendly. I don’t wish to be too negative but overall the hotel was not really my sort of place ",3/23/18,3
"Really good location and overall really good value. This is a good pick for a city break.A few things to watch out for: * Lifts are really bad. You might wait a long time for a lift and then see a ""NO LIFT"" error from the call panel. We used the stairs from 17th floor once after waiting 10 minutes. The lift system seems really really stupid; especially when the hotel seems to frequently get coachloads of people arriving/leaving. The lift panel system doesn't know the difference between 1 person and 100 people calling a lift. * Unprofessional staff really make this a 2-star hotel experience. We were shocked to receive the $40-per-day ""resort fees"" bill at the end of our stay. This was partly our booker's fault for hiding this fee in small print; but what this fee paid for was not explained or demonstrated by staff. We spent money in at least 2 stores we were allowed a discount in but didn't know. We were paying for ""bottled water"" which we never got - apparently this is actually just plastic flasks you receive to top up with tap water, these only appeared in our room on our last day. This fee is also apparently for concierge service; but on check-in the concierge clerk watched us carry our bags past him; and on check-out no-one answered the concierge line.On some days; or bed was not fully made; the quilt was just laid on top of the quilt cover and not fit inside it. Once, we were challenged for our room keys when trying to get a lift. A moment later we were told not to worry, because the supervisor had walked off and wasn't watching anymore. OK! * Hotel is noisy. Noise from outside is understandable; but noise from inside the hotel seems excessive. Other rooms sound like they're just an internal door away from you. * Room is a little manky. Bathroom has damp and one of the bath fittings was hanging loose ",3/23/18,2
"Very old and not clean ,room very small and not clean , bed very uncomfortable service poor and not polity but always ready to ask tips specially for luggages , food and beverage quite ok not acceptable serving wine in water glas ",3/23/18,1
Great location although the rest of my stay was down hill with dirty room and staff that clearly does not care to resolve issues at first chance. Between the room with dirty napkins or Kleenex on the closet shelf a missing TV remote and finding a used fork in the bed you would think maybe it was house keeping was not done yet they just had came out of the room as I was waiting to enter for my stay......that's just day 1.,3/23/18,2
"We had a great stay at Row NYC! Cesar, the hotel associate who assisted with our stay, upgraded our room without the added cost. The room was clean and comfy. Would recommend staying at the Row if you're in NYC visiting ",3/23/18,5
Cesar made me feel right at home and it was my first time in NYC 5 star hospitality. As soon as we walked in we were helped immediately and in a very polite and respectful manner. I recommend you guys stay here for your next trip to the concrete jungle,3/22/18,5
Hotel is in a very walkable location to Times Square and other major attractions. The subway can be reached easily enough for longer trips. We walked to pennstation for most of our trips but there should be closer access. Its located in a safe touristy area so safety shouldn’t be a serious concern for anyone. They allow customers to check their bags if they arrive before check in which is convient,3/22/18,5
"Perfect location, most staff were helpful and friendly, some not so much but thats life. Rooms were a typical size for NYC, small but ok. Overall a good rating. Would come back to stay in the future. ",3/22/18,4
"The hotel has provided us such a good experience. They are at a perfect location and they has a very good service. If I had to go back to New York City one more time, I would certainly stay at ROW again ",3/22/18,4
"I loved our hotel at Row NYC. It was trendy, cool, and fun. It was the perfect place to stay with my teenage daughter. The location was perfect and the food options in the hotel were a delight. I can't wait for my next visit to the city and to stay at such a cool and fun place. It was busy and full of energy and you felt like you were in the heart of it all ",3/22/18,5
"We stayed at Row NYC after spending the day at the Javits center for Vision Expo. Yes, room is small, but it's New York City, I wasn't expecting a penthouse. We checked in on the ipads in the lobby and made our room keys and went up to our room. The elevator is SUPER small, but luckily fast. We were on the 20th floor and our room overlooked 44th street. We could hear some street noise, but nothing so bad that I needed ear plugs. The room was clean and nice. The bathroom was VERY small, but again, I wasn't expecting my husband and I to be able to get ready at the same time. We walked to our dinner and to our show and back to the hotel, it was in a great location. We slept well, comfortable mattress and pillows. Room did get a bit warm, even with heat off, so I just cracked the window. Took a bit waiting for elevators. Had a drink at the bar, which was nice but still pricey. We opted to grab coffee and a doughnut at Dough in the City Kitchen. I liked that there were numerous food options right in the hotel. I would definitely recommend Row for anyone visiting NYC, especially due to it's location ",3/22/18,4
"We just spent the best week at Row NYC. The guy at the front desk, Junior, was super nice and made sure we had a great and memorable stay. The rooms are nice and clean and the lobby area had a great atmosphere. The location of the hotel could not have been better! Right in the heart of it all by Times Square. Walking distance to most things. Would choose Row NYC again any day. Can highly recommend this hotel ",3/22/18,5
"Row NYC Hotel: The entire staff from registration, housekeeping, District M made certain that my stay was the best possible experience. They provided me with great rewards from breakfast to room upgrades showed they want to make certain I will return to the Row on my next visit to New York. I look forward to returning later this year with my family. 4 Stars ",3/22/18,5
The hotel wasn’t too bad except I paid for a city view and didn’t l get this and our toilet was also broken had water coming out the top and was very loud when flushed. Other than that the experience was goo,3/22/18,3
"Location fabulous. Very busy hotel, great value for money. The staff in general were very courteous and helpful. The computerized elevator system excellent, but requires a brief learning curve, because it can be very busy. Hint: sometimes the quickest way down is up first ",3/22/18,4
Great location and ideal for business trip as its simply a clean place to sleep when you have been out the whole day in meetings . The breakfast area is great place as well and overall everyone has a smile on their face which is very important. The place is BUSY though,3/22/18,5
"Cheating with the fees. They lie with the per day rates and hide a 30$ fee per day. It is the last time I use the hotel. It is a pitty. Additionally, if you make them a but review, the page is not including it in the webpag ",3/21/18,5
"If you are a tourists.. this is for you.. busy . Hustle bustle of Times SquareNYC.. it’s a large 25+ floor hotel with 6 elevators . Rooms ok, clean, needs some remodeling, wore heavily.Ok location. Get What you pay for ",3/21/18,2
Hotel good location close to Times Square and surrounding areas. Good location to pick up bus tour stops. Staff friendly and helpful. Continental breakfast included in deal would not have booked it! Rooms tired and could do with updatin,3/21/18,3
"If you need to be in Midtown, Row NYC is a prime location. Good value for the price of the room for NYC hotels. Food options at the Kitchen were great for breakfast. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Only cons were the hallways could be very loud sometimes; the elevators were backed up a lot; and our room sometimes made a very loud noise near the windows. I would still recommend ",3/21/18,4
"This was my second stay at this Historic, convenient and affordable hotel near Times Square. The hotel is newly renovated, hip and NY sized, no complaints. The lobby is crowded times is full of luggage and guests. Our party all received email offers to ""Pre-Check In"" yet the links did not work. Disappointed to find the bathroom quite dirty with hair in the tub, toilet and on the hand towels. It appears the un-used hand towels were never changed between guests. The back of the bed needed some deep cleaning as well if you dared look ",3/21/18,3
Thanks to Cesar my boyfriend and I were upgraded to a king size bed! It was perfect for the snowy New York day we had and made it much more comfortable for us to hangout and be cozy all night. He recommended the ramen in city kitchen because he knew we were in the mood for it! Great hotel to hangout in for the whole night...thanks Cesar!,3/21/18,5
The hotel was in a good location. It had a very pleasant bar with great music. The people working at the hotel were ALL helpful and kind. Anizia was our favorite. She was one of the servers in the bar and called us by our names every day,3/21/18,3
Its on the super busiest spot. Ambience was good. I got an upgraded room. Staffs were good. I came as a solo traveller to explore the nyc for the first time. The staffs guided me well. One advice about the room service: there was no water bottle available in the room.,3/21/18,3
"Location, location, location! This hotel is indeed in a perfect location if you are looking for midtown Manhattan sights, the theaters, or Times Square. My room was cleaned promptly but most everything else I found lacking. It is so small and the extra fees are for what? Since when is enhanced wifi worth $ 30 + a day! The hotel is super noisy and while there is a store, a bar, a lounge area and a food court attached there is also no coffee in the room, no hairdryer, no onsite laundry facilities, no small refrigerators, no free breakfast or newspaper. I never got a call when my room was ready ( or a text)--this hotel caters to short stays and foreign travelers. If you get a great rate then grab it but I am returning to something like Fairfield Inn with a bright lobby. I requested the water bottles they advertise twice and finally got them one night at 12: 40 am! They woke me up to deliver them. Never saw or had knowledge of where in the hotel they could be filled. The location is great and if I got a bargain basement price I would consider it again. If convenience of the bar, lounge and food court is important to you then this is a very good match as you do not have to navigate the streets to eat ",3/21/18,2
The rooms are small but it's in a great location. And the rooms and bathrooms are very clean. Plenty of towels. The service from the staff is above average. Every other hotel should take tips from Row NY on service.,3/21/18,4
"Best location ever... 2 Blocks from times square... Clean, confy, modern cristina T great host! Free Internationals calls! Free WiFiAnd district M and city kitchen great places for food all day... Supe ",3/21/18,4
"This was my second stay. (First was January 2017.) Very good value if all you want is a great location for Broadway shows, clean room with comfy bed and good TV (essential for March Madness). Room is very tight, but quite fine for one. Could be OK for 2 as well if room ambiance isn't a priority. Nice amenities: surprisingly good bar, and the City Kitchen food court just off the lobby. A few things decreased this year's rating from 5 stars to 4 stars: place is extremely busy and worn spots are showing everywhere. Not ""shabby,"" yet, but not ""fresh and new"" like last year, either. Irritating elevator process and they are often full and slow to arrive. Place to store luggage pre and post stay is ""under renovation,"" and inconvenient, though the guys who staff it are terrifically friendly and helpful. Thanks! Overall, ROW is a really good value and I'll stay here again. ",3/21/18,4
"This hotel is in a amazing spot! Definitely one of the best places to stay if you are new to NYC. Very easy to get around the big city from this hotel as you can walk to everything due to this hotel being in a fantastic spot. The front desk were fantastic with allowing us to upgrade our room and providing information about NYC. The room was spacious and comfortable, I was hardly at the hotel due to its fantastic location within the city. One thing I must say is it would be lovely if house keeping could knock before entering the room as we woke up a few mornings during our stay to house keeping trying to get into the room... Overall fantastic hotel and would definitely recommend this hotel to friends or anyone new to the big city!! ",3/20/18,4
Enjoyed the location of hotel in the heart of the theatre district near excellent restaurants. We had an executive suite room and thought it was very spacious and fun for entertaining. Would book hotel again!,3/20/18,4
Enjoyed our stay for a convention at the Javitz center. Anizia who waitresses at the bar was fantastic. She remembered our whole crews names and made our visit very personal. Music was nice with the band on Thursday night. The breakfast options were fantastic,3/20/18,5
"I been traveling to NY in a yearly basis and despite the hotel is in a great location the rooms are very very small, the bathrooms are also way to small. Elevator H door kept malfunctioning. The gym is limited but ok. ",3/20/18,2
"I would use the Row NYC Hotel again. It is in walking distance of Times Square, fine restaurants, and the theater district. I probably saved $300 over one of the chain hotels for the two days I stayed at Row NYC. ",3/20/18,4
"The hotel is so cool, the rooms are so small (but really, as long as I can fit my suitcase in and not trip over it constantly, I'm good) but the location right next to the Theater District, Restaurant Row and Times Square is awesome. Street noise wasn't really an issue for us either. Coming into the hotel at night felt like a party! The elevator situation can get crazy, but the staff is pretty helpful. We loved being able to walk to all the things we were in town to do (see Frozen, visit Gulliver's Gate etc.), a fun place to stay and the energy keeps you hopping! We loved the complimentary water flasks, which came in handy for the kiddos ",3/20/18,4
"The service is friendly, more specifically Rob at the front desk is awesome! This hotel has nice views as well as comfy beds! I highly recommend it to anyone who is considering visiting New York and wants easy access to just about anything around ",3/20/18,5
"Great location in the city for a first time visitor. Friendly staff, clean room with great view of the city. Loved the unique setting of lobby bar. Would definitely recommend for others visiting for the first time. And never seen elevators that move crowds so fast ",3/19/18,5
"Cosy rooms...on the funky side but the hotel needs a major scrub (constantly.. heavy traffic) and their heater in the room kept me up all night, too loud! Metro across the street, and round the corner from Times Square. Location is amazing. Opted for breakfast and it consisted of one fruit, one pastry and a hot drink... cafeteria style but they had like a food market in the lobby and had good selection and plenty of seating. Would go back if they give it a good scrub a dub du ",3/19/18,3
"After a long day of work , the staff went that extra mile . Paola even laughed at my (corny ) joke . It's because of staff like this that we keep coming back ,hence the sixth star ! Centerly located, clean and a hip feel ,definitely a plus  ",3/19/18,5
"My girlfriend surprised me with a 4 night stay in New York for my birthday. The Row was awesome! The room was perfect and the commodities great! We spent my birthday night at the bar there, district M, and had a blast! If you find yourself in the area pop in and see if Anizia is working! She was our server and was super accommodating! Jarrett the bartender poured our shots all night long and needless to say had us having the time of our lives! The next time we’re in New York we will definitely be coming here again ",3/19/18,5
"Great stay at the Row! Rooms were nice, friendly staff and perfect location. Special shout out to district M which is the hotels bar! Killer service and killer drinks! Thanks to anizia for the great service and Jarrett for the amazing drinks :) we will be back! ",3/19/18,5
"We purchased a discounted room online, but the flaws of the room didn’t justify the price—the heating unit was so loud it woke us up throughout the night, there was poor water pressure, we paid a useless resort fee (we weren’t even given the measly water bottles promised), and there was evidence of mold on bathroom ceiling. The only good thing about it was the location ",3/19/18,2
"Anizia at District M. Best bartender in NYC. Make sure you ask for her! Great atmosphere. Friendly people. Check out the menu items for before dinner nosh. You won’t be disappointed in the food, the drinks, and definitely not the scenery. Enjoy ",3/19/18,5
"So... first time in NY and I have to say that Anizia properly welcomed me to Gotham City by serving us drinks, giving solid site-seeing advice and being generally wonderful. Row NYC is great and Anizia makes it perfect. I recommend it ",3/19/18,5
"Had the pleasure of visiting the lobby bar at Row NYC as it was tended by Anizia. She was extremely attentive and very helpful. She is a wealth of knowledge- if you need suggestions for where to eat and visit in the city, she is the one to ask ",3/19/18,5
"I stay at ROW frequently and I am always super impressed by the staff and service in District M. Garret is a dream come true, always friendly and offers me advice on the best places to go in the city! I will definitely be returning to ROW because of the fantastic service offered! Thank you Garret!!!!! You made my stay ",3/19/18,5
"For the price, you can beat the location, cleanliness and customer service. The room was a bit small and couldn't control the extreme heat in the bathroom, but overall very satisfied for our 3 day stay ",3/19/18,4
"My best friend and I come to NYC frequently. When we arrived, our room was not ready so we decided to go to the bar next to the lobby where we were then greeted by Jared. His personality was more than welcoming and he made our first impression one to remember! As we both work in the hospitality industry, first impressions and attitudes are everything! He was friendly and extremely attentive. Because of him we will back to Row NYC! ",3/19/18,5
"We visited this hotel in Oct 2017. Rooms were ok, clean & fresh, but make sure when you book your told about the tax. I don’t agree being charged for free gym ! Who wants to go in the gym when your in NYC !? Our provider made us aware of this nightly charge however some people weren’t & they were having hefty bills left under their doors. ",3/19/18,3
"The hotel was a great experience albeit busy, which was no surprise. No major complaints, and the hotel staff were very friendly/helpful. I’d definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NY - great location, good coffee, etc. ",3/19/18,4
"Ask for rooms away from elevators and stairs and definitely get the breakfast. Rooms are clean and comfortable. I prefer a firmer bed and pillows, but not bad as sheets are soft. Offers a great location ",3/19/18,4
Latonya and Reine were so amazingly kind and helpful at the front desk. Concierge attendants were friendly and knowledgeable and helped us navigate the city easily. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there agai,3/19/18,4
"I had an excellent experience with my stay at Row and would 100% go back, anytime. The rooms were very clean, I stayed in a city-view room with a queen sized bed and the view of the city was amazing! The room was very unique and I had no problems with the wi-fi. Row's staff was very kind and helpful - James Williams, a staff member went out of his way to accommodate us with breakfast and drink vouchers. He was very kind and helpful during our stay at Row. To top it off, the breakfast was incredible! I had an amazing time staying at Row ",3/18/18,5
"I stayed with some family members in this hotel for about 5 days. Overall the room was ok, decent. The location of the hotel is really good. When i did the check in my room wasn’t ready so they gave me 4 free breakfast passes, which i found good until i had breakfast because they didn’t have many options. Other than that i think hotel it’s good if you’re going to be out the whole day. ",3/18/18,3
Recently spent a night at row nyc with my wife and had a phenomenal time thanks to the accommodation of Cesar. He went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay and have the best night possible,3/18/18,5
"So I’ve been to NY a couple of times but this has by far been my favorite. My best girl friend brought me for four days on my bday which is around St Patrick so it’s been a good experience to be in NY but let me tell you about the 3 people that helped make it an even more memorable experience, at the hotel Row there is a bar called District M or should I say Jared , Brandon and my sweet heart Kelly they made our stay just that little more better for both of us, the total cherry on top of my cake...and the best drinks you could find in NY If you find yourself at District M look for these crazy treo Lov Dominic ",3/18/18,5
"The Hotel is in a good location though the rooms are a little small. We needed some help from customer service and Cristina T. had an amazing attitude to answer ALL our questions. If you are looking for somewhere centric close to the bus, metro, train and also close enough to walk to many attractions, this is the perfect place. ",3/17/18,4
The only positive aspect of this hotel was the location in Times Square. The bed was very uncomfortable with just a mattress. There was no room to turn around in the bathroom. The tv was not centered over the bed. Alot of upgrades would hel,3/17/18,2

"Across the street from a Shake Shack, starbucks on the next block, near penn stations and therefore subway stops. Rooms are nice but small (like most NY hotels). Staff is very friendly and helpful. The elevators are a bit different: you need to push the floor you want, then you get a private elevator to your floor. I like it but it took me a moment to figure that ou ",3/17/18,4
"We really enjoyed our recent stay at Iroquois New York. We did have to ask a few times for what I’d consider “room essentials” (ie toilet paper and glasses) but the internet was great, comfortable beds, and very friendly staff. Would totally stay again. ",3/16/18,4
Hallways were creepy because they’re dimly lit. I stayed alone and felt like I had to call a friend while walking to room. Also heard people screaming from broadway side of room all night and wasn’t well rested at all. The price is great but not sure if it’s worth the weird experience this time. I’ve stayed here before and didn’t encounter any issues.,3/16/18,3
"Blown away by the service, quality of the room and the amazing location of this property. It was super busy at check in, but Zac, our associate, got us settled in quickly and gave us a full run down of all the hotel amenities. The room was beautiful, with a spacious bedroom, huge bathroom and even a small sitting area that looked out right over one of the coolest streets in Manhattan! There are dozens of great restaurants right outside the door, Times Square is just a short block away and there must be two dozen of the top Broadway shows within 4 blocks. Considering the price, this has to be the best value within walking distance to Times Square. We were so happy with our first night we booked two more nights on the back end of our cruise ",3/16/18,5
Such a great stay. I will stay again and refer a friend... Clean and sexy elegant hotel... Cesar checked me in and was super kind. He had a pleasant welcoming energy... The staff offered free gift upon my check in. Thanks,3/16/18,5
"We stayed for a long weekend for my husband's birthday and chose this hotel for the close proximity to Times Square and the shows. The location really is perfect for walking places, and the subway is right on the corner. Depending on where we were heading that day, an easy walk or ride from the hotel.The rooms are tiny, especially the bathrooms, but enough to sleep and shower in. The corner room we had showed a good view of 8th Ave from the 11th floor, but was extremely noisy at night. Constant horns beeping and emergency vehicles going by, so it was a little hard to get sleep in. Our safe needed reset upon arrival, and they promptly came to fix it. Good service and very polite housekeeping also. My only real downside was a lack of plugs on the end table (hard to charge your phone and use it as an alarm if you can't reach it).We grabbed a drink in the lobby bar one night. Definitely not the best drink, but its a nice place to sit and hang out in the rain. We didn't have breakfast included as part of our stay, so I can't comment on that. The elevators were pretty slow and had to jam a lot of people in, as other reviewers noted. Overall, it was the perfect location for us. Close enough to walk to a lot of places (Times Square, shows, Empire State Building, etc) and right next to the subway for more distant places. We would probably stay here again for the location, but probably bring ear plugs to get some rest at night ",3/16/18,4
"COMPLIMENT MARCELO DEL COLI would like to emphasize my sincere thanks to the great professional MARCELO DEL COLL for the dedication and professionalism in all the times I have been staying at this hotel formerly named MILFORD, now ROW, for many years I have the tradition of always going to New York, staying stayed in this hotelThe reason for giving preference to being a host and the way we are treated, including myself, my mother 87 years old, we are very grateful for the caring and the way we are treated, just to give an example, had one day, that after he finished his work, took us to know the neighborhood in which he lives,He is an outstanding professional who deserves a lot of the compliments we are doing, he deserves a prominent place in this company, for the good services provided the organization.All the people that ask me here in Brazil, which hotel stay, I always recommend staying in the Row and look for the MARCELO DELL COL, because the treatment will be of the first level, it is worth knowing this professionalCongratulations MARCELO DELL CO ",3/16/18,5
Room very clean. Pleasant check in staff. We got a free upgrade of our room since a bigger room was available. Disappointed that breakfast wasn't included since it was included the last time I stayed here.,3/16/18,4
"This hotel is PERFECT if you’re not going to be spending all your time in your room, but rather exploring. The rooms are small and simple, nothing luxurious, with everything you could possibly need from free wifi to multiple towels in the washroom to and iron and iron stand even! The window view was not bad either (a beautiful view of Times Square). The winning factor is the LOCATION though. I was attending a few shows in downtown Manhattan and I literally just had to WALK to them because the hotel is so close to all of them. Love ROW, will be back for sure ",3/15/18,4
"Hotel was nearby and accessible; literally a 10 minute walk from times Square and all the major shows we had to attend. Staff was friendly and helpful when making accommodations. Price is reasonable for the rooms and room service provided. Freebies were GREAT and a perfect addition to our experience. Plenty of breakfast places and and restaurants for dinner in the area. I had to catch a show in the Rockefeller plaza and literally just had to wake up, walk ten minutes, and I was there! Overall a really great location, which for us was the main thing. I enjoyed bonding with fellow hotel mates during the elevator trips up and down the floors ",3/15/18,5
"Brought my 17 year old grandson to NYC and stayed at Row. It was perfect for our 5-day visit. Douglas, out hotel associate, was incredibly helpful. Location couldn’t have been better for theatre, subway and food of all varieties. A real deal for the price ",3/15/18,5
"Service was excellent, room was fun and cozy. Bathroom could've been cleaner. We would definitely come back. My daughter thought the beds were incredible and chose to hang out in the room before exploring the city ",3/15/18,4
"We arrived and checked in via the iPad however had to wait in a long line for our room keys as the machine with the ipads didn't work. The lady at the front desk was great and gave us our keys quickly. We arrived in the room and found black mold on the walls in the bathroom. The room was also very hot. When messing with the thermostat the air conditioning would stay on for about a minute and shut off. This lead to us having to mess with it constantly including all night long. We slept with the window open and that still did not cool it down enough. This also led to us not being able to sleep since it is so loud outside (not the hotels fault at all, can't control that). City kitchen within the hotel is great and has a great selection, however, due to the cleanliness and issues with room temp and not being able to sleep we will not be staying again ",3/15/18,2
"DO NOT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Horrible service Didn't have my room promised me a deluxe the next day for the innconvienceNext day when checking into the next room made us wait 4 hours for the room to be ready and gave us a standard and told us next time get the name of the person that promised you the deluxe So we changed room and the next room smelled really bad, it was clean tho Turned on the sink and solid stuff fell outTook a long time for the water to get war ",3/14/18,1
"My husband and I stayed at the ROW nyc this past weekend and we were rather impressed. Although there was no doorman to greet us and no one to valet our car upon arrival, which was a bit disappointing, once we got settled in our stay couldn't have been nicer. The food and cocktails in the lounge area were very much above average and we found the staff throughout the hotel to be extremely friendly and helpful. We would definitely recommend the ROW. We'll be back ",3/14/18,5
This place is a dump. For the price I would pay a little more and stay somewhere better. Thank God for the maids and they way they clean the bathroom. Everything else is small and dirty. The front desk make you wait and wait and wait for your room! They need to get it together way more. See pictures do I need to say more Oh and that was the nice vie,3/14/18,1
You can not go wrong with this hotel. Nothing fancy about the rooms but they clean and perfect for the traveler who is in New York to see the sights and not spend all there time in their room. The lobby has a nice bar lounge to grab a drink after running around seeing the sights. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place,3/14/18,5
"Good value hotel and great location. The staff at checkin were pleasant. Bar a bit expensive, but nice to sit and people watch with a drink. I was very impressed that there was good security around too ",3/14/18,5
"Very good place with a first class localisation and very near of the subway , rooms are very clean and big enough , he bar is fine with good drinks and nice music , sometimes we must wait a little bit to long for the lifts next time I come to NYC I'll choose the same hotel ",3/14/18,5
"Very busy hotel great value compared to many other hotels. Nice staff and very cute rooms. Some rooms have great views and more then one window, awesome. The elevator is very strange and hard to get used to, I don't think it works well with this hotel as its the busiest hotel ",3/14/18,4
"The room was very small, extremely loud, cleaning staff knocked in the door at 8am until 11am multiple times. By the way leave ten minutes early because the elevators are awful. So small and they stop at multiple floors even though no one else can fit in the elevator ",3/14/18,2
"This is my second visit to Row, NYC. It is well located close to the theater district and easily walkable to all the fun sites in downtown.The hotel was clean and safe. It also had coffee, breakfast and drinks at night. I felt comfortable walking everywhere. My friend and I walked about 10 miles which gave us time to enjoy sites as we walked. We took a ton of pictures ",3/14/18,4
All rooms are small. Prefer the high floors. Location is a must. Close to the subway and to Manhattan’s main attractions. Junior at the front desk is very helpful and speaks portuguese. Besides that front desk lines are huge. The elevators are packed most part of the times. Be careful with your personal belongs.,3/13/18,3
"We visited The Row for a 5 night stay and were really pleased to be informed there was a room with a good view available. Cesar at reception was very helpful and welcoming. We were told that rooms can be small in this hotel, but if I'm honest our room was perfect. Enough space to get changed and an en suite bathroom. The staff were all very helpful and the maids in particular were very patient when we wanted a lie in. The room was cleaned properly every day with new sheets and towels. The booking stayed free bottled water, but there was a fountain outside the room and cups supplied. The water machine provided boiling and cold water and both tasted filtered.I will add that being in the centre of Times Square, the rooms are noisy. We went prepared with earplugs and slept like babies. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were feather and were not comfortable for me. (hubby liked them though. )The amenities are so close and the train is 2 mins walk and Central Park 15 mins or a stop on the train. I've provided 2 photos of the views from our windows. Hudson River and up 8th Ave ",3/13/18,5
I stay in this hotel any time only thing it needs to be more cleaner Close to everything times square Staff Very nice and helpful I had a fantastic time I even had a drink on the bar My view from fantastic too,3/13/18,5
Great location. Theatres are close by and the subway is around the corner. 2 blocks from Times Square.Not fancy but perfect for a short stay. Rooms are comfortable. Our second stay at this hotel. Great food. The walls are thin and the hallways are a bit noisy but the rates are good for what you get,3/13/18,4
We have just returned home after 6 days in NYC staying at Row. We found the hotel was very pleasant the check in was smooth and security was good. We stayed in Room 1204 this was quite small for 3 persons but clean. We asked for directions at the front desk and found the receptionist very helpfully. We were allowed to have late check out and the receptionist was brilliant her name was Morial (spelling not good). I would recommend this hotel,3/13/18,4
"The best part of our stay at the ROW was the experience with Mr. Junior's guest service, on Saturday night after Storm Riley! We arrived in NY exhausted and not knowing if our reservation was still valid (we were retained in 48hs in Atlanta). Mr Junior was totally understanding, efficient and professional. Without a doubt, the ROW will be highly recommended by me, thanks to its staff composed of dedicated professionals such as Mr Junior and Mr Marcelo Del Col. The rroms are fine and clean ",3/13/18,5
"This place is gross, dirty and beat up. Hallway and rooms smell like smoke, disgusting. Nothing like the pictures, room and beds are tiny. Closet is a joke even by NY standards. Self check in broken and no signs posted so people kept trying without success. Check in process slow and under staffed. Stay awa ",3/13/18,1
Row NYC is perfect ! MARCELO DEL COL we love you! I’d like to say Thanks Thank you very much for your attention! You MARCELO DEL COL is the best ! See you in June ! Congratulations! Row e Marcelo Del Col together make the difference!!! See you ! Thanks! Thanks!!,3/13/18,5
"This hotel is so convenient to Times Square and the theaters. Good quality of restaurants nearby as well. Junior was very helpful at the desk upon check-in and personable. the complementary breakfast was easy to obtain, good seating, and delicious. ",3/13/18,5
"It wasn't the best hotel i've been to in nyc. When I tried to use the self check in kiosk, I completed it all the way until the step to create your own key, the key device didn't work. I like the bathroom tub fixtures but there was a lot of old fxtures (the door was old and the gas heater was old) ",3/13/18,3
Zac at reception was amazing... super friendly and went above and beyond to make our stay special. Room had a great view of Times Square and was spacious. Very convenient location as well. Highly recommended,3/12/18,5
Coming to NYC you have a lot of hotel choices. ROW NYC should be at the top of your list. It's a no frill experience that leaves you with a beautiful clean room and smack dab in the heart of Times Square. I had a room on the 23rd floor. I could leave the window open and get some fresh air while not experiencing all the noise from down below. Room was very clean and the bathroom shower was terrific.,3/12/18,4
Great place to stay and great location. Very modern. Food and service was good. The shower was a little skeevy but other than that we had a great time. Definitely booking this hotel again. Elevator service was a little slow so be prepared. Very high tech and like how the sugar factory was connected to the hotel.,3/12/18,5
"Booked hotel through SnapTravel, and got an amazing deal for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend. No problems with my reservation, check in, or check out. (Love the mobile check in/out) SnapTravel requested a room with a view for me, recieved a room on the 28th floor with a beautiful city view. Best part was it was just around the corner from the broadway theatre we were attending, and in perfect walking distance to so many restaurants / time square. Will stay here again. ",3/12/18,4
Stayed here for 4 nights . First night our door got tried 3x second night kept awake most of the night with the couple next door arguing rather loudly for hours .. cant fault the staff on the front desk as they got us a new room which turned out to be a bigger size and had the best view .. Would've liked a cup of tea at another time other than breakfast . also the resort fees . dont start me on them.. basically paid $138 for wifi that was used only for the few hrs a day we were actually in the room. Resort fees shoud be included in the price at booking not when you arrive and get hit with that to pay on checking out . i didnt use any other facility there it all seems a bit greedy to me just another way to get more money from people . puts you off wanting to come back . shame cos NYC is a great city.,3/12/18,3
"We had to stay here after our trip was rebooked due to poor weather and the company had to change the hotel - so disappointing! If you want a bed to sleep in then that’s what you’ll get here. But it’ll be in a tiny room, grubby carpets, dusty floor in bathroom, panel behind TV was taped up with cellotape. They only provided 3 pillows with 2 people staying in the room (strange if you ask me) however they promptly delivered me an extra when I asked - though on the 3rd day when our room was cleaned they took the pillow back! And it took me a good 2/3 hours to get a new one brought up! Breakfast wasn’t included though not the end of world as location of hotel is only bonus -perfectly central so lots of wonderful places to eat for breakfast! There’s hundreds of rooms in this hotel and as other reviewers say at the busier times (weekends in particular) you can wait an obscenely long time for a lift. I feel like this hotel is just trying to cram as many people in as they can without a care for the experience - the rooms really are a disappointment when this is a special trip! ",3/12/18,3
"Great hotel, great staff, rooms cleaned daily shop not as big as I thought. Would be nice to have tea making facilities in room or a machine in foyer. Being English the time zone meant I was waking up about 1am breakfast not on till 6.30 so along time to wait.5minute walk to times sq ideal location ",3/12/18,4
"Liked the hotel. Bed really comfy. Don't waste your money on the breakfast. Go across the street for an excellent homemade type breakfast. Had to ask for wash cloths multiple days since there were none in the bathroom. Also, get ready for them to overload your email. I finally had to send all of them to spam. The hotel is literally around the corner from ""Phantom of the Opera"" and just a few blocks from Times Square. Overall, I would stay again ",3/12/18,3
"I would not recommend this hotel. The queues to check in were so long, key cards did not work, elevators were a joke...took 15/20 mines each time to use. Heating in the rooms also really poor. Overall experience was not good! ",3/11/18,2
"Hot, hip, accessible, thought-thru hotel right in the middle of the action with a band playing on Thursday nights and exceptional food choices. The rooms are tiny and basic but also fun and again well designed. Stay here with humor and for value and convenience ",3/11/18,4
"The hotel was very cool, really nice rooms, clean bathroom and excellent location close to Times Square but not right next to it, Broadway, food and transportation are a few steps from the hotel. Very easy check in and check ou ",3/11/18,5
"Booked for four nights for a 30th birthday. Marcelo checked us in very pleasant as the staff around reception were talking to each other didn’t acknowledge us. This man was finished his shift saw us and was very helpful. Hotel itself is in a good location right in the middle of everything. As for it’s condition it’s extremely grubby. Truth be told my heart sank when I saw our room. I wore shoes as the carpet looked so bad. The blinds were filthy. Extraction vent in bathroom filthy. It looks like it has been painted again and again just covering up the dirt. Rust around socket plugs. Broken furniture. Never again would I stay here, only for I didn’t want to stress us out and start if the trip by wondering around looking for a hotel I would have moved but it would have just eaten into our time in New York. The lobby area also grubby and so run down. It’s was a major disappointment when this should have been the trip of a lifetime. ",3/11/18,2
The Row is a great value. The hotel is conveniently located to transportation and to cultural venues. The rooms are bright and cheerfully decorated with windows that can be opened. The staff is very helpful. A great place to stay for your stay in NYC,3/11/18,5
"Loved our stay! Stayed for 5 days only and loved every minute of it. Great service and very friendly staff especially from Cristina.T. which was on hand to listen to our needs and to give us informations and advice,despite there were many people. Room was on the smaller size, but was comfortable and clean with fantastic view and timely room service. When in NY next time we will definitely return her ",3/10/18,5
My stay at this hotel was amazing. The room was great and the location is perfect. I wanted to be able to get to and from the city. Douglas at the front desk was very helpful as well. I will come back.,3/10/18,5
"First time staying at Rowe. Nothing but positive experiences. I did not wait long to check in, and I was greeted by Douglas. He is extremely accommodating and polite. Made me feel welcome and was attentive to my needs. I have a great room, and will definitely recommend this place to my friends ",3/10/18,5
First time at this Hotel. Walking distance to everything even in bad weather if you dress correctly. We walked to all 3 plays we saw.And to Central Park & Time Square Also had tickets for taping of The Chew on a rainy morning walked there als,3/10/18,5
"Great hotel. Best location, right in Times Square, very convenient for visiting the Big Apple. Recently renewed. Nice room, super-confortable bed. Helpful staff. Can’t say anything bad about it. Second time I have been, just loved it. ",3/10/18,5
"Junior at check in was amazing, so polite, friendly and helpful. Took his time to explain all of the facilities the hotel has to offer. Once he found out it was our anniversary he upgraded us and sent a fruit plate and bottle of Prosecco to our room. Such a lovely touch. Everyone we came across were extremely helpful and friendly.The location is brilliant - we got the air train then subway in from JFK and we ended up across the street from the hotel. Cannot wait for my third visit in December this time Christmas shopping with a friend!! Thank you to all who made our trip so enjoyable ",3/9/18,5
"Different reasons that made my stay in Row Hotel a great experience: nice staff, very comfortable rooms, great breakfast and coffee and the City Kitchen, a food hall with different restaurants where you can find all day long very delicious food like hamburgers, sushi, lobster, mexican, lebanese.. ",3/9/18,5
"It was really good, a great location, really nice looking, the only bad thing was the price, a little high, and an additional fee of 11 dollars for each received package, room was small but nice and the carpet may need a deeper cleaning ",3/8/18,4
"Wow, first time in New York and couldn't have had a better welcome. How fortunate we were to have Junior serving us. On arrival he decided to move us to a room with a view as it was our first time here. He took so much time going through the map with wonderful practical suggestions as to how to make use of our short break while getting the best value for money. We will back and we will be staying here! ",3/8/18,5
"Great location near theatre's and Time Square. Check in was easy at the kiosk. Nice food court with lots of options in the hotel. We did experience a couple of areas where this hotel fell short. We did not have hot water in our bathroom sink our entire stay despite notifying hotel staff. Also, the rooms were not as clean as I would have expected. Bed linens and shades were dirty. ",3/8/18,3
"I don't appreciate the added fees tacked on at the end. I believe they should ask the guest if they want to use the gym, pool, Wi-Fi, and the phone, don't just add them on your bill. Also, Clean sheets and a clean bathtub would have been nice for a room that cost over $200.00 for one night ",3/8/18,2
"ROW NYC is a decent, affordable, hip hotel in a great location! Staff I interacted with were friendly and willing to help. My single room was small compared to other hotels, but it wasn't TOO small! Safe held my over-sized laptop, which was a plus. Would stay here again ",3/8/18,4
"I'll start by saying I was supposed to take this trip back in the summer of 2017 but had to cancel because of a death in the family the day before our trip was scheduled. Thankfully the staff understood and once they received a copy of the death certificate refunded my money fully without fuss. I decided to stay here when I replanned the trip for March 2018 and finally arrived. The hotel has a very young cosmopolitan feel, with acid jazz playing in the elevators and a bar with live bands in the lobby. We felt safe with the bouncer by the elevators and a nice staff. The rooms were a bit on the small side but very clean and it's a 5 minute walk to times square! I felt the price was great for the quality of service and I'll stay here again on my next trip to NY ",3/8/18,5
"I was a guest at your hotel last month and just wanted to let you know that the staff that served the continental breakfast during our stay was very helpful, nice and courteous. The crew working on our first morning there were exceptional. They were: Jasmine, Juan, Jacob, Javier, Kelly and Beto. It is always nice to see a smiling face first thing in the morning. Susan H. Peoria Arizon ",3/8/18,4
"The Hotel it's self was very modern and nice, good location ,your staff however were very snappy and rude also hidden chargers are not on . With a few education lessons on customer relations and working chargers into original prices would make a judge difference ",3/8/18,3
"We enjoyed our stay, close to all the Broadway shows, great restaurants and the time square shopping. NYC is one of the most fun and exciting cities in the world. We plan on returning for more Broadway shows and catch a Yankee game this summer ",3/7/18,4
nice view but won’t come back. Did not feel safe. Homeless people in lobby. Also elevator system was terrible. A man was assaulted while we were there and we had shower problems. Best thing was view.,3/7/18,2
"Based on cost and location we could have done better. Hotel service fee was too high for items we do not use & a discount card provided that was not accepted at their food court. Also, the food court had exterior access so anyone off the street could enter without going in through the hotel itself. Too much access to the outside and the front desk does not monitor the elevator which anyone could easily enter ",3/7/18,3
"It is so easy to book and to check in, and out. The location is great and the hotel is efficiently run. I make a point of getting the continental breakfast, which has been served by the same people for all the years I have stayed at the ROW, so they must be happy with their job, and they get my day off to a good start ",3/7/18,4
Nice clean hotelGreat location Nice and helpful staffQue to check in 30 mins after a long flight only 2 staff! Rooms yes they are small but manageable we was 2 adults 2 teens with 2 double bedsA little wait on lifts sometimes but nothing major it’s a big hotel there will be a wait at times. Would not pay to add breakfast not worth it,3/7/18,5
The hotel front desk Ms. Jastania made us feel so special.I booked the room for 9 nights for my friends visited from Japan. I made reservation on line but I needed some request. So I visited the hotel front desk and she helped me for all my request. The hotel is one of the best location if you wanted to see Broadway show. Also there is many lines of Subway in a few blocks away so you are able to ride subway/bus with no confusion,3/7/18,5
"It's all about the location here. Small rooms but neat, tidy and modern. Great little food court downstairs to have breakfast to prep for a day exploring NYC. The rooms are small but spent very little time in it apart from sleeping. Great location extremely close to Times Square if you are after the tourist thing. We used the hotel for a business trip and a few extra days for a holiday ",3/7/18,4
The hotel is in a great location near Broadway on 8th. Perfect if you are planing on going to some shows. There a lot of great restaurant options just steps from the entrance. My only issue is the room size. The basic room with a full size bed is almost too small for two people,3/6/18,3
"They charged the room for higher than the price of the reservation online, stating that “it was a mistake and the room shouldn’t have been listed at that rate”. I can’t even believe that I had to explain to them that this is not the customers fault, and that I should not be charged higher than what was listed online. I tried calling the front desk from the room several times to question my bill, they wouldn’t even pick up. They also charged $70 for a car we never parked. They wouldn’t answer my emails. I called four times. It took THREE MONTHS to get a refund for the car I didn’t park there. I can’t even believe how awful this place is. My friend booked the room through a booking site, and put my name on the reservation as I would be the first one to arrive. She even called the hotel ahead of time and gave my name to a staff member. After waiting in line for over half an hour to even get to a human at the desk, I was told I could not check in because my name wasn’t on the reservation, despite my friend calling ahead of time. The clerk gave me a huge attitude and said this wasn’t allowed because she had used a third party site (wtf??). The only way I could check in is to have Hotels.com call the hotel and give them my name. I sat in the lobby for another hour, and my name still wasn’t on it. We called Hotels.com again, and they said they repeatedly tried calling and no one was picking up, they sat on hold for several minutes. When I brought this up to the desk, I AGAIN got an attitude reminiscent of a middle school girl. The next day, house keeping knocked on the door three times before checkout time had even approached and gave an attitude about when we would be leaving, despite me repeatedly telling them we would be out right at checkout time. The housekeeper rolled her eyes! ",3/6/18,1
"Just got home from an 8 night stay here (it was 5 nights initially, but winter storm Riley lead to our flight being cancelled and hence the extra stay!). The rooms are basic but comfortable, staff are friendly and the location is second to none. You are literally in the heart of NYC a couple of minutes from Times Square. Our room had an amazing view over the central buildings in Times Square and for the price we paid I honestly couldn't believe it. When we needed to extend our stay staff were excellent and even managed to accommodate us in the same room so we didn't need to move our things. Tips : There's an amazing little pizza place directly over the road, Smiths bar across the street has fantastic burgers. Don't bother buying drinks from the street vendors as they'll try to screw you on price, go to the 7/11 around the corner ",3/6/18,4
Great Hotel - Outstanding location. Very clean amenities and close to the main locations in Manhattan. The staff are polite and very helpful. Definitely a place to come back on my next visit. The ROW has a very good service for an affordable prive,3/6/18,5
"It was our first time at Row, and although it´s a very large and busy hotel, we had and overall nice experience. Fast check in and check out, the room (a standard) wasn´t as small as similars (or as I was expecting), it was clean, had a nice vibe and a very friendly staff, and it´s worth mentioning names: specially Junior who welcomed us at check in and when realizing we were brazilians immediatly started to talk to us in portuguese and explained everything we needed to know and more. Was very helpfull and even was able to get us a late check out as our flight was only at 11 pm. We felt trully welcomed and would recomend this hotel to everybody, although I speak english my husband doesn´t and I imagine many other brazilian tourists don´t, and is very nice when you have someone who speaks your language, specially if you're dealing with procedures or solving issues, and even more if it is someone as nice and sweet as Junior ",3/6/18,4
"I stayed in this hotel on the last night of my visit to new york. Having stayed in a very mixed hostel, where I had my phone and tablet stolen, I wanted to finish off my time there on a high. This hotel certainly did that - in a perfect location with extremely helpful and accomodating staff. My room was a nice size and very clean. With the hotel being just by time square it made it the perfect location to explore new york and all there was to see. Could not be more happy with my stay here ",3/6/18,5
"I absolutely loved this hotel from the moment I got off the airporter shuttle from jfk because it was in perfect walking distance in time square from where I was dropped off at port Authority. So the location was great but also walking inside was well decorated hotel and super friendly staff. Speaking of the staff, I had a hostess/ reservist name Shantelle and she was truly a pleasure. Not only was she super polite but extremely knowledgeable as well. Upgraded my room to one with a view and detailed everything about charges and services perfectly. Came out to solo to celebrate my birthday with friends who are locals to NY and to my surprise this hands down was the best trip I’ve ever taken. My room was very spacious and had a beautiful view of the New York City streets. My bed was extremely comfortable and huge,I believe it was a king. And over and beyond because it was my 30th birthday... Shantelle went out of her way to send me and welcome message along with a bottle of champagne and two glasses directly to my room Truly brought me joy and made me definitely agree to come back to stay here when I’m back in New York. Thank you so much again Row nyc and Shantelle ",3/5/18,5
"This place is cheap, you can't fault them on that. Although there is an additional tax of $30 per night for certain facilities. Otherwise, it's a good location and cheap price.The rooms are, well, what you pay for really. They were basic, our bath was weird though as a certain patch of it was spongey, in that it squished down when stepped on, I can't begin to understand why that might be ",3/5/18,3
very professional staff and nice welcome. Cristina Torres provided an excellent assistance upon my arrival at the hotel. She is very client-oriented and very professional . The room was cleaned and the entire environment very secured,3/5/18,4
"My partner and I booked this hotel last minute just days before we were due to fly out to JFK. On arrival to JFK we took the subway to 42nd street port authority bus terminal. This took us just outside the hotel. Upon arrival when we were checked in we were told if we found the room too noisy we could change rooms in the morning. We though it was an odd thing to say and went to our room none the wiser. When we got to our room on the 15th floor we soon realised we were directly behind the elevators which was extremely loud. We tried to change rooms that evening but the hotel was fully booked. They gave us complimentary drinks as a gesture of good will. In the morning we were able to change rooms and were put on the 17th floor (premium floor) where we had a much larger room, bed and a view of the city. We were extremely pleased with how accommodating the hotel were to ensure our stay was enjoyable. The hotel is in an exceptional location just behind Times Square and right next to broadway. We were sceptical about the hotel when we booked it as other reviews had said the rooms were very small. I could not complain about this hotel, it is very clean, and did the job while we were there. Would recommend this hotel. ",3/5/18,4
"Stay 3 nights the only thing which make very happy is walking distance for all theaters, time square and others.But wait for the elevators on rush hour is horrible! Staff are friendly. Pleas, put chairs on each floor this way we can wait for the elevators!! I was 26floor and run late all the time ",3/5/18,3
"My friend and I stayed at Row NYC just before Christmas for 6 nights. We were initially really excited as the hotel looked nice online and it photographed well, however, we left feeling pretty disappointed overall. Just before we flew to NYC, we checked our reservation and saw that the hotel were charging taxes on arrival (which I understand normal) as well as a fee for facilities/amenities. We were horrified to learn that we would be paying $180 as soon as we arrived, despite the fact that we had already pre-paid for our booking. The only facility we used that we were aware of was Wi-Fi and I have no idea what else we paid for. This is the first US hotel I have stayed at that does a separate charge for facilities on arrival. $180 is a lot of money to part with, especially for something that could be included in the price when you book. The hotel is in a great location. There are plenty of places to eat and you are right next to Times Square. Of course, this means that there are tour bus sellers who stand outside the front doors all day long... Annoying after the 3rd/4th day. The hotel rooms were small but enough for two, and the beds were comfortable. We paid a little extra and had one of the corner rooms with a view which was worth it. We did find long black hairs on our towels and rubbish in our bin which was a shame. The staff on reception were friendly but the security guard was extremely rude and abrasive. Our rooms keys didn't work and he demanded to see our ID before letting us in (even though we had just literally checked in). I also left something behind in the room when we left. I went back to collect it and he would only hand over the item I had said I left, he wouldn't give me a hat my friend had left because ""I had not reported it as missing""!! I wouldn't stay here again purely based on price and value for money ",3/5/18,3
"In order to get you to select this hotel when comparing prices, they charge a $30/night resort fee at the location so that you think it’s cheaper than it is. There’s no resort. They said it’s for the gym and phone- but it’s required. There’s no rationale for this other than hoping you don’t see the fine print and buy the hotel on your app by mistake. The entire business model of this hotel is designed to get you to purchase and then be less than promised. Clearly they are seeking 1 time tourists onnly ",3/5/18,1
Cesar was excellent when we were checking in. He upgraded our room for us when we got there from a room with one bed to a room with two beds which was much more comfortable than it would have been. The room was a nice size and very clean. Will definitely be back in the future.,3/5/18,5
"I was charged an extra $68.84 on my debit card by the hotel at checkout for ""facility fee"" after I had purchased the room online. That has never happened to me in many years of purchasing online hotel rooms. They were unreasonable about refunding this money when asked. Also the room is very small, and you can hear your next door neighbors very well late at night. The elevators are always full so we had a very hard time getting downstairs in the morning. Also there was hair on the furniture. I would definitely not go there again ",3/5/18,2
The Hotel was nicely located close to Broadway and Time SQ. Very helpful & friendly staff. Room wasn't as clean as I would have liked apron check in but made a call to house keeping and they addressed it right away,3/5/18,4
"Stayed here on a Wyndham promotion, but reasonable prices can be found. Short walk to Times Square; plenty of restaurants/bars nearby. Lobby bar has breakfast items and an attached food court next door. Queeen room was decent sized but heat was a problem in spite of recent maintenace to the system. Needed to crack the window for sub-freezing air to cool down. ",3/5/18,3
"I booked this hotel for four nights last February. At first I was impressed by the lobby decoration, and gave me the impression of a very nice hotel. Unfortunately that´s not the case. The room, like most in NYC, is not large enough for a family of three. The bed are too small to fit a couple. I stayed in a room facing 8th avenue, the noise goes on all night long, making it next too impossible to get a good night sleep. The heater makes all kinds of noise, and maintenance did nothing to repair it. The staff at the reception is extremelly rude, and won´t do much good if you need any assitance.To top all that, there´s a amennities fee that is charged for the use of the wi-fi. They charged me $137,00 plus taxes, which makes this probably ythe most expensive internet in the world.The only plus side is the hotel location, which is right next to Times Square, but I strongly recommned not to stay there ",3/5/18,2
excellent value for money helpful staff great location what more do you need views amazing you have to way up what you pay how much time you spend in your room as if your are a tourist as we were easy access to subway could see times square out of window,3/5/18,4
"We actually visited the Row hotel over Christmas 2016, the hotel is very nice and the rooms are kept well, don’t forget about city tax that has to be paid along with a service charge the hotel charges for telephone and internet usage, I think it was about $25 per day so it can add up to a lot extra above what you pay for the room, the hotel does not have its own restaurant, but there is a small food court in the lobby area that gets very busy at times, but prices are reasonable. The hotel is only a 2 minute walk to Times Square so this hotel is a great all round option, it’s well priced and convenient location make it a hotel I would stay at again ",3/5/18,4
"We visited for a weekend, from the UK & were generally very impressed with the hotel. The location is great, just a couple of minutes walk from the action of time square, and with plenty of decent bars & restaurants in the area. The lobby area has it's own food market & an excellent cocktail bar! Visit Smiths Bar, across the road, if you fancy something that feels genuinely New York.The rooms are quite small (we upgraded to the Superior but space was still pretty tight) but this is to be expected in a city hotel. That being said, they were well equipped, with a decent hot shower (always important to me when travelling) and we had a cracking view down 8th Avenue.The building is old, so they are some issues to be expected with a structure of this age. There were some problems with the lifts, on a couple of occasions, but the staff managed this well & allowed us to use the tradesmen's lift.Do beware of the facilities charge when booking, other wise it can be a surprise when you check in! We would definitely use this hotel again ",3/4/18,4
"The hotels rooms were tiny but clean. No amenities other than a tv. Had to ask for luggage rack. No coffee, no micro, nothing. Oh iron and hairdryer. Shampoo and conditioner but no lotion. Security alarms went off three times during stay. Quite annoying. Decor in hallways unusual. Employees were very nic ",3/4/18,3
"This hotel is in a great location, close to Times Square and an easy start point for on foot, subway or bus travel. No complaints. Rooms are fairly basic but fine and the bed was comfy. No issue with the cleaning service except they forgot to leave bath towels one day. (Towels could be bigger and fluffier though!). Room only is probably best option, bar prices and food expensive and there are plenty of places around to get breakfast etc st a much better rate. Staff are helpful and friendly. 'Bouncers' by the lifts seems a bit odd but no doubt help keep non residents out of the building, protecting legitimate guests ",3/4/18,4
Room- is ok (3/5)Location (4/5)Cleanisses(3/5)Comfort (3/5)New york is noisy .. always can hear siren and cat horn. Check in quite slow . Not worth the price paying for . Location is good . Staff also goo,3/4/18,3
Could not get a better location for Times Square Central Park and broadway. Hotel was busy but ran smooth. Room was small and could do with updating but had everything you need. Would definatley stay there again no problem,3/4/18,4
Stayed again at The Row and you are right in the same block as all the latest Broadway plays. Rooms are simple and small but quiet and clean and the best thing is that the people that work at the hotel are very friendly. We needed a room change and Caesar who is one of the hotel associates was so helpful and accommodating that I really appreciated it. Nothing fancy but very enjoyable and their elevator system is the best!,3/3/18,5
"Spent three nights here. You can’t beat the location or price for staying in the theatre district. A word of warning though, the rooms are small, about the size of a college dorm room...but you don’t come here to stay in the room! Noisy and loud on Sunday night but overall reasonable. Room was basically clean (a bit less around the edges of the room) with good housekeeping services during our stay. We would consider staying here again because like I said, you can’t beat the location ",3/3/18,4
"Before we went to NYC we read really mixed reviews on this hotel. But for us the rooms were clean(and cleaned everyday) not the most luxurious but it had everything we needed. The beds were comfy etc. The lobby etc in the hotel was gorgeous and they kept our bags when we checked out which was great (no charge) The location of this hotel was amazing, so close to everything. Would definitely stay here again ",3/3/18,5
Great location. Round corner from Times Square. Hotel clean. Busy hotel!! Staff friendly enough. Only downside is checking in waited in a long queue. After travelling for 12 hours we had to wait for an hour and room Wasn’t ready till after 3pm. But I’d defo stay there again,3/3/18,5
Zac took care of us at the front desk ! He knew all the the hottest spots for my husband and I to hit for our first time in New York and gave us web pages for discounts the bar in the hotel had great music and drinks and we danced all night! We have been married 8 years best time we have ever had,3/3/18,5
"Douglas greeted us warmly and helped us with all questions. He is very professional and sympathetic. A big thank again to him. We got a very nice room with a view of the city. The room was relatively clean and, unlike reviews, it was not loud. The hotel has a great location ",3/3/18,4
"Booking a 3 night stay in NY can be a bit daunting , where is a good place to stay . The Row for us was a great choice , short walk away from Times Sq and close to all the key tourist attractions.On arrival at Newark airport we got tickets on the Newark - New York shuttle bus , this stops about 5 min ealk from the hotel.The hotel is very busy but from our experience is well run , rooms are very small but are clean and comfortable. To be honest other than the room we didnt use any other hotel facilities so couldn't pass comment on those .I am sure you will plan your own time in NYC but if i can recommend one thing its the NY Pass . Awesome value and allows admission to so many attractions , the Big Bus is a great way to get about and see the city. Recommend Row NY9/11 MemorialBig Bus TourEmpire StateStatue of LibertyRockafella sit ",3/3/18,4
ideal location in times square small room but very comfy reception staff really helpful breakfast was lovely lovely place to stay right in hells kitchen area beers a bit expensive in b the hotel but i expected that for the are,3/3/18,4
"Walking distance to all the Broadway shows & Time Square that's the positive. Overpriced and the rooms are extremely dated. The service wasn't very good either, and the parking/valet situation was ridiculous. Unfortunately, the homeless problem flares it's ugly head right outside of the hotel. Disappointed, but made the most of it ",3/2/18,2
"Well priced and very central to all attraction every thing is within 10 mins walking distance,shopping,tube.attractions.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.The staff we very helpful even at busy times. ",3/2/18,5
"Thanks, Kathy! On a rainy cold and very windy day, we arrived at the hotel several hours before check-in time. We were greeted warmly by a Kathy, who found us an available room instantly and upgraded our reservation. A very welcome friendly face. And of course the room and the hotel are very comfortable - and short walking steps from all Broadway’s theaters. ",3/2/18,5
"Ok so where shall I start..... over all experience was pretty good as we were hardly in the hotel so was just really a place to sleep at night but I shall list all pros and cons of this hotel. Pros- 1. 2 min walk away from Times Square and literally next door to broadway! Excellent location. 2. Hotel room and bathroom was very clean and the hotel maids cleaned up daily and refreshed towels etc 3. Beds were comfy 4. Staff were helpful, helping with our bags on arrival5. Security always checking you have room keys before letting you use the lifts to the rooms which is reassuring as very good security in hotel. 6. Very reasonable for the price. You get what you pay for basically. Cons- 1. The heating was switched onto full when we first entered our room and was literally like entering into a sauna, far too hot! It made us feel ill. We had to keep the window open slightly at all times due to not being able to switch the heating off and air con controls not working. 2. There is only a sliding door going across the bathroom with a huge gap so you get no privacy whilst using the bathroom and can see and hear everything. 3. No shower curtain so when having a shower the entire bathroom flooded!!! 4. Rooms absolutely tiny but we didn’t spend much time hauled up in our rooms.5. Told there was a baggage room to leave our bags safe when we checked out. We were told there was no charge HOWEVER when we went to leave our bags the guys there asked us for a tip and when we handed $5 as that’s all we had they laughed and asked if we were on a budget and that their service was worth far more than $5.....we just stood there in complete shock and walked away. 6. There are additional charges that you’re not made aware of at the time of booking. So an extra $30ish per night is added to the bill to cover phone/WiFi and the computers to use in the lobby. Will probably end up staying here again if there aren’t any other reasonably priced hotels around the same area however the main thing I will say is PLEASE sort out that heater that’s in the rooms and let us control the heat. It was just unbearable!!! ",3/2/18,3
"Our 1st trip to New York feel somewhat let down by the hotel, at 1st sight the lobby and bar area are lovely but this is clearly where the money is spent as the rooms are tired. We changed our 1st room as it was TINY, dirty and the sliding bathroom door did not slide! Our 2nd room was a better size but very dusty and still the sliding doors on the bathroom do not allow for much privacy as do not fully close, in this room both the bedside lamps did not work but this was fixed when we called concierge at least. It would have been nice to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room as a side point too. When checking in we were presented with a bill for $134 for service charge?! This was the 1st we were told about this which may have been the fault of our booking agent but equally we did not need the wifi or the onsite gym so I was not happy about having this unbudgeted compulsory extra bill. The breakfast that we had paid for as part of our booking we were informed pick 1 piece of fruit, 1 pastry and either a tea or a coffee, never have I ever been somewhere so limited, it was a joke, not even to have juice or cereal option?! At the end of the day we used this as a base to explore which it is in a good spot for subways etc but am sure there are much better Hotels in the area to pick from ",3/2/18,2
"The convector in the room was broken and the room was like a sauna. One of the mattresses had given out and needed to be replaced. The floor manager checked both things and said they needed to be, and would be fixed and they were not fixed. The maids took away the wet towels but did not leave us new ones do we dried off the second day with hand towels. The front desk does not answer their phone so if you want anything or need info you must go and stand in line to speak to anyone ",3/2/18,2
We stayed at Row NYC again and were not disappointed. We were happy to see Junior again and knew our experience would be as great as always. Easy check in and breakfast was included with our reservation we made with a Facebook code. Only wish something other than coffee and tea were offered at breakfast since we don’t drink either one. Still a piece of fruit and a pastry were good. Minute walk from theaters and bus that comes from JFK for $19 a person. Talks about 20 minutes longer than cab but worth it if not in a hurry. If more than 2 people a cab is better choice based on $68 price tag. Gigi’s pizza place is a short walk near Columbus square by Central Park and offers tons of food including wraps etc. we got special of 2 slices pizza and can of soda for $5. Recommend Row NYC. I know we will be back next year,3/1/18,5
Absolutely fabulous location. Hotel staff are all very pleasant. Hotel room not very upmarket but you are not really in your room very much. You really do not need to do the hop on hop off bus as you are in Times Square and the Theatre District. Metro is cheap & fast.,3/1/18,3
"We were in the city for a surprise 30th birthday party that I was hosting. I tried to see if they can arrange something to keep a small cake in the refrigerator for me. Was blatantly turned down, and not in a very nice way. i left a voicemail for a manager, did not hear back for days. Called back and after not having anyone at the concierge desk, I was transferred to the front desk staff. The staff member I spoke with was a woman who was extremely rude and arrogant. She was more frustrated than I was to have the situation on hand, and pretty much told me to just come in the day of the event and speak to whoever was there and see if they would feel pity and let me keep it somewhere. I called a competitor hotel where my guests were staying closer to Colombus Circle and they were ready to put it in their own breakroom fridge or the restaurant fridge if the cake didn't fit in their guestroom refrigerator. We kept the cake there and our guests happily brought it with them. I was so disappointed in the Row staff. Definitely will not be staying at this place ever again. Will post this review online ",3/1/18,1
$30 per night non-waivable fee for internet and phone. Rip-off. Extra $62 for two nights. Also there is an open gap between bathroom door and wall. Can hear everything in thr bathroom. Felt cheated by the hotel.,3/1/18,1
"Amazing location- next to times square, theatres and Subway. But the rooms were horrible. Felt and looked unclean and there was another smoking guests smokingsos the Funes were coming through the air vents and I didngd get a good night sleep. In addition they charge a so called facility fee for using their internet and phone. Honestly I rather take my money to the Westin hotel next time ",3/1/18,2
I read some reviews and was a bit apprehensive as to what we would turn up to But clearly people just like to moan This hotel is in a brilliant location 10-15 minutes in any direction to the nearest major attraction Hotel is busy regardless of time we ventured out at 330 in the morning and the reception and bar still had many people milling around good atmosphere and good vibe all round Many people who have written reviews on here complained about the lifts .... It was easy you just put the floor number in and it directs you to the lift for your floor ... Not complicated at all Rooms are quite small but that didn't bother us as it was just a base plenty of hot water in bathroom and extremely clean we stayed 3 nights and bedding &towels were changed twice in that time We had two rooms one on floor 14 (internal room with no view )and one on 21 (with a small view of Times Square) the complimentary breakfast was a large tea or coffee( if you want English tea best to bring your own tea bags as they had none for two days but again not a big issue) you also get the choice of a bagel or Danish pastry and some fruit which was plenty the bagels and Danish were quite large so was quite filling really there is also the city kitchen with a variety of other dining options (the cinnamon sugar doughnuts were amazing )The facilities fee isn't too bad to be fair I can see why it's charged and we did use the the wifi and Internet and printers to do our online check inLuggage room they do expect a tip when you drop your luggage off and also depending on the times they expect another one when you collectAll in all a great hotel in a great location I felt very safe in wandering the hotel and vicinity on my own and we will defiantly be staying here again on our revisit,3/1/18,5
"Location cannot be faulted, unfortunately no other positives. I appreciate when coming to NYC you don’t spend too much time in your hotel room, but from disengaged front desk staff to unhelpful concierge & feeling like cattle being herded when using the very, very, very slow lifts, it wasn’t a great experience ",2/28/18,1
"Poor personnel attitude toward passengers needs. Elevators not working most of the time and, when asking for a solution, the woman in charge of the emergency elevator was extremely impolite. Concierge wasn’t available to help me solving a major issue I had with the transfer compan ",2/28/18,2
"Hotel location is great, Overall we found the hotel to be very average, our card was charged multiple times after checking in, none of these were explained at check in. Elevators slow and reception always crowded ",2/28/18,3
"After reading previous reviews I was a little concerned about my arrival. Upon arrival check-in was quick, friendly & informative. I think Robert (?) served us! We were allocated a complimentary upgrade & complimentary drinks at the bar as we were visiting for my husband's surprise 40th birthday trip! It's a busy hotel, so a lot of people hanging around the lobby & others meeting up for drinks at the bar. There were no issues with the elevators - all 8 of them, simply key in your floor number & wait for allocated lift. The room was spacious enough, very clean & well serviced throughout our stay by housekeeping. There are water stations on every floor & the hotel provide collapsible drinking cups. The bed was so comfortable & rooms so cosy. If anything the bathroom was a little on the small side but well appointed with everything you need. Hairdryer, safe, iron/ironing board & TV also in the room as well as heating/air conditioning. The location of the hotel is great with plenty of variety for eating out, shopping & sightseeing. I would definitely return. ",2/28/18,5
"My husband and I arrived at the ROW NYC with a speedy check-in. The lady who served us was very pleasant. We was given a lovely room situated on the 22nd floor, giving a glimpse of times square which was lovely. This room was spacious and had everything we needed. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to see the broadway shows located just around the corner and shopping in times square. Most tourist attractions are within a reasonable distance from the hotel. Thankyou ROW NYC for providing us with a fab stay. We will come back in the near future ",2/28/18,5
"For anyone looking to book this hotel be aware, whatever your booking site says about all your fees being paid, you will still be charged an extra $30 per night facilities fee as well as a $50 per night deposit on top of the room fee. The deposit is paid upfront at check in. After checkout the hotel keeps the facilities fee and return the difference to your bank account.We stayed 13 nights at Row NYC and it if weren't for the non-refundable price we locked in we would definitely have cut our stay way shorter. The first room we were given was super tiny and also hadn't been turned over with dirty sheets and cups of water left around the room. So we made the journey back down to the lobby via the elevators that try to pack 15+ people at a time into one elevator to swap our room key. Our second room was fine upon our arrival, but there was little consistency thought our stay. A different number and variety of towels every time we came back to our room. Some days our linen was changed, mostly it wasn't. On top of this there were some other strange occurrences such as hunks of congealed dust flying out of our air conditioner (yes we had the air-con running in November, to combat the pretty stuffy room probably not helped by the 4ft square patch of floor that was always inexplicably hot). In essence for roughly $400 a night ($200 per person, on sale) we got a bare minimum room (2 beds, a bathroom, a desk, a lamp, a TV and a safe in a ""wardrobe"" behind a curtain). No room service, no amenities and average housekeeping (we had to pile our rubbish all together for like 3 days before they took it). If you want a simple room for a short stay you can probably find better for cheaper. The exterior and and lobby might make a good Instagram post but after that the experience lets it down. There's an abundance of hotels in Manhattan and around Midtown where you can actually get your money's worth. ",2/28/18,1
"Great staff, nice rooms. We had a problem with the heater, and they resolverd really fast. Steps away from restaurants, bars, coffee bars and Times Square. Great location. Loved the bar area. My husband and our friends, all together had a great time here ",2/27/18,5
"Everything was great, the location, the bar, the staff. The rooms were nice sized, great view of the city. We requested a later check out time and the staff accommodated with no problems and they also let you keep your bags at the hotel after you check out to see more attractions if you like. ",2/27/18,5
"We stayed here for the weekend (2/16/18-2/18/18), mostly because for a two night stay, it was quite a bit cheaper than the Hilton Garden Inn we stayed at the previous year. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite up to par and I will probably stay elsewhere next time we come up for a show. While the hotel is centrally located to the theaters we were attending, as well as tons of food and drink options, and not too far from Penn Station, the same can be said for many other hotels in the area, so that's not necessarily anything special. Upon checking in, we were stopped by someone who appeared to be the concierge, who started by asking if we had any questions and if he could help us plan anything. Normal concierge behavior. When we did not, he started trying to convince us to spend some of our weekend attending a breakfast so they could tell us about a new hotel their parent company was building in the area. It was very reminiscent of a timeshare pitch and felt sleazy. Given this person's proximity to the front desk (and the ACTUAL concierge), it was pretty obvious that he was affiliated with the hotel and was authorized to be doing this to guests. The room was clean of dirt, though the bathroom, especially the tub (which was one of those ""bathfitter"" shells over an older tub), clearly had paint slopped on it from a remodel. It matched the color of the trim. That's not really a big issue, but combined with everything else, it was irritating. More concerning was how thin the wall seemed to be that separated us from the neighboring room. You could hear just about everything. Our room was in a corner and had an interior door to that adjacent unit, but I've stayed in plenty of other hotel rooms like that without the level of noise. Lastly, with regards to the room, the water/pressure in the bathroom went a bit haywire on the last morning. The other 2 days we were there were just fine. Since we were leaving that morning, I didn't bother to report it, but it would've been impossible to shower in the state it was in. Hopefully that was an unusual occurrence. The only other thing that struck me in a negative way was a policy of the hotel checking to make sure you had a key to a room before allowing you into the elevator area. However, this was only done at night. Another reviewer mentioned how many young people stayed at this particular hotel, which we also noticed, and that makes me wonder if this is some measure the hotel takes to keep partying to a minimum. Not terrible, but it is another example of an overall lack of class. Overall, I would likely not stay here again given the plethora of hotels in the area. While it was a bit cheaper per night, the cons very much outweighed the cost savings ",2/27/18,3
The hotel was very clean and the location was excellent. The service was great and staff was very kind. I would come back next time in New York. The view was very good too. The places to eat and the bar at the hotel were excellent an convenient,2/27/18,5
"AC did not work in room, engineer was not able to fix. Checkout experience was terrible, front-desk people did not have correct final amount in our bill, so almost missed our train back. Terrible experience ",2/27/18,1
My third stay at this hotel. Stayed on the 20th floor in s corner room and the view was fantastic!! Went to the hotel bar and had s great drink made for us and the bar tender gave us a great recommendation for supper! These rooms are not huge but are more than adequate for the price point.If I had to say anything negative it’s that the elevators were wonky on Sunday.I will keep returning to this hotel,2/27/18,4
"Just had a wonderful experience with Row NYC. I had booked a AAA package that included parking, but when I went to get my car from the garage I was told that the validation I'd gotten only gave me a discount, so I owed $80, which I had to pay to get my car. Once I got home I called the hotel and was instantly given an email address to write to, had a response within a day and the $80 credited to my account that same day. Many (many) thanks to Eliane Matamoros in accounting for handling it all so graciously and efficiently. And the stay itself was wonderful - perfect location for seeing shows and getting on the subway and the attached food court made it so great during rainy days. Every staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful, the view from our room was wonderful and the WiFi was strong.....this is our new go-to hotel when visiting Times Square ",2/27/18,5
"Great location, very close to times square, restaurants, shops and shows. Very friendly staff, rooms small but clean, exactly what you want for a short break away. Look forward to coming back in the future ",2/27/18,5
Hotel is well situated just off times square. Nearby subway station makes most places of interest very accessible. Good nearby restaurants and bars. Best request a room higher up the building to avoid noise.,2/27/18,4
"this was my second time staying here and it was brilliant! check in was quick and easy. Douglas checked us in,he was very friendly and welcoming and gave us a room on the 14th floor which had a great view down to times square! the room was cleaned everyday and towels were changed as we needed them! its a great location and times square is just down the road! wifi is excellent.. connects as soon as your in the hotel and you dont have to constantly sign in! would 100% recommend this hotel! ",2/27/18,5
"First time staying at the Row and I was thoroughly impressed with the staff both at check in and with bell services. Douglas at the front desk was very helpful and accommodating with securing me a slightly later check out time. James from bell services was extremely polite and was still more than willing to help me carry my luggage upstairs even though I didn’t have any US cash on me to tip with for his efforts. While the room itself was on the slightly small side (most rooms in New York are, that’s just what to expect!) everything was super clean and comfortableVery good central location and close to an array of shops, entertainment and food options, including Times Square and the theatre districtAmazing first stay at this hotel and will definitely recommend! The only thing is I wish I had a hairdryer in the room :) ",2/26/18,5
"I have stayed at many hotels in NYC as I travel here often, never ever have I been treated so well when entering a hotel. The door man had a huge smile on his face when I entered and got me up and on my way to the lobby where I was greeted by Douglas! Douglas was such a delight and helped me check into my room! He made sure I had everything I needed and more. I’m so excited about my stay here:) what a beautiful hotel and friendly atmosphere. ",2/26/18,5
"I always enjoy staying at the Row nyc whenever I get the opportunity to stay over in Manhattan. The guest rooms are small, but they are all very nicely decorated with vivid graphics and colors. The hotel the staff is always very pleasant and helpful, whether it's checking you in or supplying extra towels. For the price you cannot beat the location of the hotel, it is convenient to EVERYTHING you could want to see in NYC ",2/26/18,5
"The hotel was good and was modern. It had a self service style check in and check out so contact with staff was minimal. The location of the hotel is perfect as you are close enough to Times Square without being affected by the noise etc, very near to sub way stations and the port authority bus terminal. This we found handy as we managed to catch a subway and the air train when returning to JFK for less than $8 each. Rooms in the hotel were clean and maids visited daily. The standard room was ideal for my friend and I, however if you were travelling for a longer period of time you may require more storage. Although the hotel always appeared to be busy, there were no issues with getting an elevator as the high tech system required you to select floor number and it directed you to a specific lift. Very pleased with assistance at the hotel with regards to luggage, the whole second floor is dedicated to storing luggage. Good value for money would definitely return ",2/26/18,4
"I am an ex hotel manager so I know what to look for but in truth an old fairly large hotel, conveniently situated. Rather tired looking in various places and clearly well sold to large groups of young people who frequently clog up the rather small public areas. Room ok, somewhat hot and ours overlooking avenue through rather grubby windows. Beds comfortable, room and bathroom clean and good size, friendly maid who was very helpful after my son had a nose bleed In changing bedding. Big miss in room was no drink making facility. I frequented shop over Road more times than I can remember keeping my good lady serviced with Tea. Lifts adequate / hot water just about, evidence of security check of room key and corridor deep cleaning. Extra charge per night per room of 30+USD for well not much. Wasn't offered breakfast, could see muffins / bagels on offer for 6or7 dollars a piece. That's expensive. Over the road Carve do great breakfast for similar money. On the whole we were quite happy with Row NYC ",2/26/18,3
"If you're looking for a great location, minimal accommodations, and a decently priced hotel - this is it. The location was perfect for me and my friend's 3 day, 2 night stay in NYC. We saw Anastasia on Broadway which was literally right around the corner, as well as any Times Square areas we wanted to see. The hotel, however, had originally said we were paying $90 a night (which turned into $140 per night). I believe that all fees should be given up front, which was not done. Apparently you get discounts with other vendors for staying at the Row, but we were not told this. The rooms are very tiny and there is not a lot of sound proofing between rooms, so if you are a light sleeper - this is NOT the place for you. Also, the hotel elevator situation is an absolute NIGHTMARE. You have an assigned elevator to go to - no buttons within the actual lift. Overall, it was pretty average ",2/26/18,3
Great price if you consider the location. Breakfast options very limitated and also you have to pay an extra fee for having it included. No minifridge or coffee machine at the room wich usually it is something very normal at this pricepoint,2/26/18,4
"A superbly located hotel a stones throw from Times Square and the Theatre district. Having read so many reviews I wasn't sure what to expect as so many positive and negative ones. I must say I cannot fault the hotel. Yes the rooms maybe are a bit dated but in general our room was clean, comfortable and was kept the same every day of our stay. There were no issues at all with checking in... the concierge were great, The front door men were wonderful too. Amazing location and would definitely stay there again.... ! ",2/26/18,4
Everything about this trip was amazing! Location of this hotel was perfect. Rooms were small but clean and all you need for this type of trip. Staff were great and we had a pleasant experience overall. We will definitely be back to Row NYC in the future!!,2/26/18,5
"Perfect for visiting 3-5 days New York. The hotel is located at 8th Avenue, corner with 44th street. Decent price (quality / price) and many emblematic places around to sightseeing. One Subway stop placed just in front of the hotel ",2/25/18,4
"Pros : Nice and close to Times Square, theatres & subway stations. Toiletries, hairdryer and air con. Lots of reasonably prices delis for cheap breakfasts. Cons : Our double room was pretty cramped, very noisy, dirty, quite tatty (in need of a good clean and a lick of paint). When we checked in we were told that when we checked out we would need to pay 'city tax'. I've paid this in hotels all over the world so wasn't unduly concerned. On the last morning I awoke to find a bill pushed under the door telling me there was no need to check out as $176 had been charged to my credit card. I wasn't happy about this as I thought I'd paid for everything in advance. Turns out this is for : the internet, phone calls, use of the gym, use of a disposable water bottle and the ROW discount card. We used the internet (which we thought was included in the cost of the room), we weren't told about the discount card (we actually had paid full price for drinks in the bar) and we didn't use anything else. By the response of the person at the desk it's clearly an issue she's dealt with many, many times. She actually stood with her hands in her pocket while we spoke with the duty manager who just kept telling us that the travel agent (Thomas Cook) should have told us about this extra fee. I feel that the hotel should have given us ALL the information at the time of check in. Waking up to a large charge on the last morning was very upsetting. So Douglas, despite you asking me to leave you a 5 star review you're getting a 1 star ",2/25/18,2
We arrived at 9pm after spending s days traveling from Darwin. The customer service was fantastic with Douglas upgrading our room and giving us free drinks on arrival when our room wasn’t ready straight away.,2/25/18,5
"The location of this hotel was just perfect. We saw a show literally just round the corner! The rooms are a little on the small side, buy hey I am on holiday and don't intend to spend all day in an hotel room!. The room was lovely and clean, with fresh towels and linen everyday. All the staff were friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again. Oh and loved the free international phone calls. Was able to keep in touch with my elderly mother. Never had this facility before - well done Row NY ",2/25/18,4
This hotel is perfectly located and has very good customer service! They do everything they can to satisfy their customers. A special thanks to Junior at the reception for making our stay a fantastic experience. He is very polite and helpful,2/24/18,5
"When I arrived to the Hotel, it was like a madhouse of guests either checking in or out, I don't know which. Teenagers all over lobby floor re-organizing their suitcases, so it was a mess.Got to desk, to check in, and they said they would see if I could check in before 4 pm. The room I ordered wasn't available, so they had to give me alternate room with 2 beds instead of 1.Got to room, and saw the carpet was old and dingy. Black and grey. Filthy. The room looked old and tired. Not inviting in the least. I was almost afraid to take my shoes off because I wasn't sure if floor had bugs.The beds were made up, but what was supposed to be white sheets and linens were kind of ""off white"" instead. Not sure who does their washing, but they need a new company.The Decor was old looking black and white furniture, Pictures on website were more inviting than actual room and hotel itself.I was supposed to have a Deluxe City View, but what I got was not a good view at all. I could barely see city view. Moving on... Restroom was dusty. Looks like maids don't clean thoroughly due to high volume of tourists and guests. Bath tub was not very clean. I had to clean it before I took a bath, just to feel comfortable.The only reason I stayed here, was I had already booked and paid for my stay on Hotels. com, and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find anything else on short notice as this was my 1st trip to NYC.Location......was very close to Times Square and that was the best part of the trip. I was outdoors for the last 3 days and nights, sight seeing ect.NYC was the bomb!!!! :)Would I recommend this hotel?? No if you are picky about cleanliness, and overall presence. Yes, if you are just looking to crash and be near Times Square and you don't care if you lay in a run down room. Mind you Feb. 22 was my 50th Birthday, and this is why i came to NYC in the 1st place...Feb. 201 ",2/24/18,2
We booked and had seen some reviews which was worrying but we had a lovely time at this hotel which was very central to everything. We got an upgrade to a room with a view because we emailed as a special occasion. The rooms are small but this is New York so that’s not an issue especially when you’re out most of the time and your feet hurt from walking you need less steps to get to the bathroom. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. Reception was wonderful and had no issues at all.,2/24/18,5
"We are currently staying here for the week, will be leaving here tomorrow, the food is lovely and also the staff, the cleaners come everyday and re do the whole room daily (even strips the bed sheets). We are in the middle of everything, very central! My partner has been using the gym downstairs when we have free time, would definitely come here again. Only annoying thing is that the tour guide people stand outside the hotel but thats probably everywhere else anyway. Room was a bit smaller than expected but lovely when you get used to it! ",2/24/18,4
"The reception staff at check in were warm and friendly. The initial room we were staying in was quite small for two people but the room itself was clean and the bed was wonderful after 30 hours of travelling. As they could not upgrade at at check in, the next day we asked for an upgrade and we were moved to a much more spacious room with a beautiful city view - which I loved. For this we did pay an extra fee and we had to store our luggage on the 2nd floor and come back at 4pm to check back in. This gave us plenty of time to explore the city. The location is fantastic, so many great places are just a short walk away, it’s also easy to hail a taxi or get an Uber. The lounge in the hotel is nice and the bar staff were helpful with drink choices as well as chatting to us and giving us their tips about the city and other cities we are travelling to. Both Junior and Robert at reception helped us and their customer service was 5 Star. If I could pass on any tips to people thinking about staying here:Please be advised about facility fees. Read the T&C’s before booking. It’s an extra 26-30 USD per night to be paid directly to the hotel. Check in time is 4pm. You can store your luggage at the hotel if you arrive before this time. Please consider tipping the staff that do this for you. Also leave a tip for the staff that clean your hotel room each day. We are only part way through our stay but I can confidently say I would recommend this hotel to friends and family. ",2/24/18,4
Good apart from noisy fan at rear of hotel which kept us awake. Comfy beds and room tidy and clean. Decor a little worn and in need of a refresh. Great location by Times Square so well positioned for sightseeing,2/23/18,3
I don’t even know where to start... this is by far the worst hotel I have stayed in. The rooms are so small and dirty. The sheets alone were all stained and yellow with small pubic hairs all over them and in the bathroom. The lifts are a complete nightmare and take forever. The noises from the compressor is unbearable and leads to sleepless nights. I wouldn’t even bother trying to phone down to reception because nobody bothers to answer the phone but all of the above aside the worst part of it all is customer service. The service is disgusting and shocking nobody even cares and are clearly just here for a pay check. All in all I would highly recommend staying away from this hotel as it’s a disgrace.,2/23/18,1
"We had a 3 night stay at row nyc, checking in was easy the man at the desk was lovely (I just can’t remember his name) it was very loud n busy, we got upgraded to a city view room, which was nice got some good pics, room was small but it didn’t bother us. So the first night we was knackered I had a 6 n 14 year old with us, and about 12:30 am we heard a hotel worker open our door and try and walk in and tell us we had to check out, thank god we had the lock on, my husband told him to go away then half hour later a women came and did the same thing, it did freak me out that anyone can just walk in to your room, we told the lady at reception and she couldn’t believe what had happened, in good jester she let us off with the bill of the $86 at the end of the trip, good location for time square and great places to eat ",2/23/18,3
"This Hotel is an enigma: you must know what you want. This Hotel is location, location, location. The rooms are just fine as everything in NYC every bit of space is utilized. Rooms are conservative in space. if you get here and want to be petted and fawned over yah good luck with that. but if you are looking for a Hotel to stage out of, to experience NYC, to the fullest this is your hotel. The Hotel does a large business and the volumes of people surge at time with no predictability, we got there about 1:30 pm walked right up and registered, but we are good like that. The desk staff was polite and direct to the point. their ads claim they will charge a usage fee and they charge a usage fee, surprise. they do not give out rooms until 4:00 pm EST but will store your luggage for free until you can obtain your room, setting you free to enjoy NYC. Here's a free tip, at the elevators pay attention; you select your floor on the outside of the elevators and then watch the screen it will tell you which elevator to get on, A,B, C etc. don't just jump on an elevator no buttons inside the elevators. lol it was great. The bathrooms have a sliding barn door for some privacy it's fine. The stay here is what you make it for us it was Excellent ",2/23/18,5
"Very pleasant stay! The staff was really friendly! Special compliment to Junior, he was very helpful and kind with our checkout! The room wasn’t really big, but it was good for NYC, renovated and clean. The only complaint is regarding the elevators, the wait was really long and it was always crowded. Definitely recommend the Row. Great location and I would definitely stay here again ",2/23/18,4
"Tiniest room ever. Not even a soap holder in the shower (not enough room for one). No coffee or tea making facilities in the room. The safe either doesn’t work or the instructions are incomplete. Checkin is slow with a long queue every afternoon. Hardly enough room on the floor for a suitcase. No water provided in the room, no glasses provided in the room, instead a plastic takeaway cup that doesn’t even fit under the tap in bathroom. No room service, no in-house movies, wifi signal is too weak for in-house channels. Feels more like an upmarket backpackers. Location is excellent for Broadway, Times Square and Hell’s Kitchen. ",2/23/18,3
"The room and staff were great but 17th floor and street noise was bad. The location was great clise convention center and Times square, Broadway and great restuarants. If you go make sure you are above noise level probably above 20th floor ask them.I am a lite sleeper and i could hear the cars and people talking ",2/23/18,4
"Nice place to stay and not a far walk from restaurants, subway and attractions. Hotel should have coffee ready in lobby for clients by 6 am. Nice to see that this hotel is utilized as a shelter for moms with kid ",2/23/18,5
"Me my wife and our 6 year old daughter have just spent 4 nights at the Row with another couple and there daughter. It has been a good experience. The pros of the hotel were a great location with Times Square within a two minute walk. A quick and helpful check in service with the lady moving us, so that both parties hotel room close to each other . The rooms were tidy and the city kitchen had good food and a good choice ( the doughnuts are a must ) The cons where the most expensive resort fee which made the wi fi the most expensive service ever at £30 per day The non existent collapsible water bottles, which are meant to be part of the resort fee . Extremely thin walls, you expect noise in the big apple but you don’t expect to be hearing your next door neighbours every wordOverall great location, adequate hotel....... at the end of the day your in New York ",2/23/18,3
Great experience! Very comfortable beds. Small rooms but perfect because no need to stay in your room when you are in NYC! Felt safe in the ROW the entire time. Employes were extremely helpful. Convienent location.,2/23/18,4
"1. The hotel is in a great location. 2. The rooms have been clean in my several experiences staying here.3. The staff are usually very helpful.I give the hotel a 3 rating, but when I factor in Gezennia’s help at the front desk, the hotel gets a 4 rating. She was professional, personable, and helpful. I give Gezennia a 9 rating for her customer service experience. I very much appreciate her help during my last stay. ",2/22/18,4
"Had a good time in NY with family was a little disappointed with the hotel as when we got there we had to pay so much per room. Rooms are basic with beds, tv, dresser and bathroom. Saving grace was it wasn't dirty and plenty of places to dine out and everything was very central to where we was. Including Time Sq, Empire State, Central Park and Madison Square Gardens. Loads of other attractions too, overall very good holiday but little disappointed with hotel facilities.. ",2/22/18,3
"It was a really good time spent in Row! in the heart of Manhattan, close to Time square. Great service and good staff to welcome you. Nice accomodation, with a security checking everyone before going inside. Great experienc ",2/22/18,5
"Genuinely think you could not get a more central location for the price of this hotel if you tried!! Our room was on the 20th floor and the window looked directly up 44th street on to 7th Avenue where we could see the hustle and bustle of Times Square. The hotel itself is on 8th Avenue between 44th and 45th street, it was so central to everything and pretty much walking distance to everything there is to see mid-town. We walked to Empire State, Rockefeller, Intrepid, St Patricks Cathedral, Central Park, Madison Square Garden, Central Station, Macy's... the list goes on! All of the hop on/off buses have stops right beside the hotel also if you want to travel Downtown.The room itself was tiny but that is expected in NYC; the bed was comfy and it had the amenities required for what you need - as in NYC you just need a place to sleep and spend very little time in the hotel room itself. Shower was great, always hot water and very clean. We had our towels changed and room serviced every day.For a first time visit to NYC this was definitely the best place to stay, without a doubt. If I were to go back, I would prefer to stay Downtown as I am much more familiar with the area and Downtown Manhattan is just something else!! All round a fab hotel and well worth a visit ",2/22/18,5

"One day they did not clean the room, the next they did not put the towels in the bathroom and in the other they only wanted to change the bathroom towels. Very expensive eating or drinking in the hotel ",2/21/18,3
"Very kind and helpful staff. Nice rooms not to big, but good enough. Lovely soft bed, good wifi and the best of it all. It is at a magnificant location, right at te middle of all the must sees. Would definitly visit agai ",2/21/18,4
"We had a wonderful week in New York and “Row NYC” was part of it. Our room locate at the fortheen floor were clean with view over the city. Great location, close to “Time Square” and the theater district ",2/20/18,5
"I don't usually give negative reviews but...We had prepaid for 3 nights through Booking.com. When we arrived we were informed that we had a balance of $90 due.For what we asked. Ready? A ""Facilities Fee"" they charged us for reserving through Bookings.com.Ah, what does this fee include. Wifi, ,(as listed in hotel amenities. )Phone priviledges. Really? my cell works fine.A fitness center.(as listed in hotel facilities)Use of their ""business lounge""Last but not least; We received a collapsible water bottle for their filtered water! I can go on but to be honest it's draining.Lay your head elsewhere ",2/20/18,2
"Small rooms, thin walls, extremely loud. Room could of been cleaner. The furniture is high gloss and shows wear and tear easily. Most of the staff was rude except for one gentleman at the check in desk. ",2/20/18,2
"Excellent location, very close to Times Square and the Broadway. Nice hotel with some rooms with a nice city view, It is a question of preference: better view or larger room space. Very good internet connection in the rooms. Continental breakfast short for a Continental classification. Hotel lobby large but always very bustling ",2/20/18,4
"Arrived for a 5 night stay from Ireland.. check in was fast and staff I encountered were pleasant the elevator system was easy to use. The room was clean two double beds which were comfortable.. the noise from the elevator was noisy to bearable. The room itself was ok could do with a revamp, chips out the woodwork and not a lot of storage space. The location is fantastic and I had food in the city kitchen a few times which was lovely. ",2/20/18,3
Really enjoyed this location. Right off 42 street. Near all the great shows. The hotel has a great bar. Food court. Fun decorations. Friendly staff. Places to eat all around you. Quick walk to everything.,2/20/18,5
"Mabuhay here in Philippines, we were guest last December 24-25'17 to spent our christmas eve for the 1st time in New york and our experienced were so fabulous and great tonstay because of modernized concept of their rooms, because as i observed some of the hotels we stayed in new york were quite old-fashioned and traditional but in ROW NYC HOTEL was advanced in terms of checking-in and out process, their elevators were secured and most especially in handling an unexpected cases that i encounter during we were in new york... due to busy and hectic iteniraries and plans during holidays i accidentally click a wrong options in the ""APPS"" for an online hotel booking and I lost my reservation instead of just upgrading our room and because of country barrier as a foreigner, its really hard to contact between the hotel and online apps because our cellphone was set on a roaming mode just to avoid overcharging but then again, its unintentionally not to show in the hotel because no more bookings for us so we immediately find other hotel immediately due to very cold winter weather. As i expected they will charge me for only 30%reservation but when i saw my bill they charge me for 100% full so i was very shocked and panic... i immediately contact the ""apps booking online and the hotel row nyc, requesting for a refund or waived and i explain what happen but infairness with this hotel in a very short period of time with no hesitations they understand my situation and they grant my request for a refund. They solved my burden in extra charges in my bill and they help me out to relieved my stress from my mistakes and they handle it very well specially with MS. ELIANE MATAMOROS with her ACCOUNTING/SALES staff and because of that i really salute the ROW NYC HOTEL for their golden-heart and good service relations as their priorities for their guests and not just for money... I highly recommeded the ROW NYC HOTEL and if i given a chance i definitely come back here with no doubt... Again, thank you very much and i really appreciated all your efforts Best regards, Dra. Anisferre Ferraren Ortiz ",2/20/18,5
"I stayed at Row NYC back in January and I still find myself talking about it and suggesting it to friends and family. The location was fantastic. Everything I needed (pizza, shopping, a broadway show, a drugstore, a dance class, a wine bar, etc) was within a couple blocks of the hotel. Our room was perfect. I loved the safety of knowing everyone had to have a room key to get to the elevators/rooms. My favorite part by far was the bar/lounge area though. The atmosphere was great and the bartender Jose made the BEST food and drinks suggestions. EXCELLENT customer service. He was friendly and super attentive, and always greeted me with a smile. Definitely make sure to have one of his Moscow Mules ",2/19/18,5
"Robert was so nice to us! Thanks for your advice for the rooms & views, we had a TOP service! We had already booked a room and I asked Robert, what he thinks about the view.

"I stayed at the Row NYC in Febraury 2018. The Hotel itself seems modern and the location is perfect. Nevertheless there are some minor issues that the hotel provides to its guests. The cleanliness is not the best and the facility itself is not in the best condition (Door didn't shut completly, not working power plugs and the room being either too hot or cold as the AC wasn't working properly). Considering these issues it is unreasonable that the facility fee is so overpriced ($34 per night?). During the booking process I was already wondering what the reason could be, that this hotel has much lower prices considering other hotels in this area, well now I know why. I wouldn't book with this hotel again as I feel quite ripped off. ",2/19/18,1
"Mixed feelings about Row NYCProsLocation is fab. Minutes from Times Square and Hell’s Kitchen for eats and comfortable distance from Rockefeller, Madison square gardens and Bryant Park. Price was good but do be aware of taxes and fees added in all NYC hotels. Room was cleaned and fresh towels provided everyday and the concierge was helpful the few times we needed advice. ConsThe room was awful. Old and run down and tiny. The bed was smaller than a standard double and walls are very thin. We woke up every night from the sound of the elevators going up and down. The additional facility fee of £20 each night is robbery. There are few facilities to avail of. We went to get water from the fountains on our first night and it was cloudy and undrinkable. So a very mixed bag. We probably wouldn’t stay here again as there are other hotels very close by with equally good locations that may offer a more comfortable space for a romantic week away. ",2/19/18,3
Location is very good. Room is very very small. Needed to be better cleaned. Nice bed. Check in could be better. Parking took time. Loud no matter where you were in the hotel. Heating unit was loud. Larger towels,2/19/18,3

"Can't beat this hotel. 2 blocks away from Penn station, right in the middle of the theatre district. We went to see ""Beautiful, the musical"" matinee and an evening show of ""Hello Dolly"" with Bette Midler. The hotel is literally a few minutes from both theatres. We got a lovely view with our room. Basic hotel room, nothing fancy. Just right for our needs. Planning to stay here again. ",2/18/18,4
"Let’s start with the rooms. VERY dirty and small. I got crammed into a corner room, which looked like it was even finished. Let’s move onto customer service. Honestly I’d getter better customer service at my local mcondalds. First hotel I’ve been to, where no one answers the front desk or concierge line. I think I tried calling about 30-40 times. I honestly don’t know how you guys consider yourself a hotel. I recommend no one ever stay here. ",2/18/18,1
As soon as I see the foyer I knew not to expect much. I am here with my daughter on her 21st Birthday and had fortunately been staying at the Double Tree Hilton. However we decided to stay an extra night in New York and chose this place. Location is good but trust me I would rather stay on the moon than here. We arrived from other hotel with part of our luggage quite early and was told by reception to see some fella who would sort out our luggage. We explained that we would be returning with more luggage whereupon he asked for money for him to take care of it. Believe me I don't mind tipping but I found it a liberty to be asked. Further check in is late 4pm but moving onto room less time in a box is better. A double room 4 two people lucky we are not on the large size as we would not have been able to get into the bathroom. It's a dark dingy hotel. Never mind not here long thank God,2/18/18,1
Row is my favorite hotel for a great stay in Manhattan. The location is awesome and the bedrooms are well cleaned and organized. The staff is also friendly - specially Junior. He speaks portuguese and always helps me and my family!,2/18/18,5
Got this on a cheap few days deal. First impression it is a big hotel located next to times square and near to all the central attractions The hotel is going through a small refit but this didnt cause any problems.No problems with booking either in or out.The lifts worked well and were easy to understand.The room was a decent size with basic and plain fittings. Clean and tidy with red hot showers.The only neg points were an uncomftable bed and the outside noise the 2nd you get used to but woke up every 2hrs due to the bed and soft pillows.In all a fantastic location for the price would stay again,2/18/18,4
"We stayed in this hotel for five nights on a package deal through our local travel agent. The hotel is well located and within minutes walking distance from Times Square and many other Midtown attractions. There are plenty of nearby restaurants, diners and bars to enjoy. It is also a short walk to several metro stationUpon arrival the reception staff were little more than polite, but there was no warm welcome and I left the check in feeling we were more of an inconvenience than welcome paying guests. Our room was no more than adequate but the hotel was overall a disappointment. The hotel appears to have undergone renovations that are more of a ‘paper over the cracks’ than full refurbishment. The website photos do more justice than the reality reveals! We arrived as a family group albeit all adults and were allocated rooms at the rear of the building. The rooms are small but okay. The room was clean and reasonably furnished but definitely has the feel of budget about it. The maid service was sporadic and generally involved little more than a change of towels. On one occasion we returned to an unmade bed and in vacuumed floor. The rear of the building forms a U shape and at the base of the building is a huge steam vent that released plumes of steam at about 10 minute intervals day and night. The noise is like a jet engine firing up and the shape of the building acts like a chimney funnelling the steam and noise up past bedroom windows! This makes for disturbed sleep and the windows are poorly sound proofed so even tightly closed there’s no escape. On one night the heater in our room spontaneously and loudly gurgled into life blowing unneeded hot air into our room and I was unable to switch it off with the room thermostat control. The hotel lobby area is a busy and often chaotic as this hotel seems to be a go to for large groups such as school, college and sports teams etc. The hotel has a bar next to the lobby, but It’s very expensive compared to outside bars. A small can of beer was more expensive than a full pint elsewhere! There is WiFi available but you end up paying for this through the hotels facilities charge that gets automatically debited from your card at the end of your stay. As we didn’t use any of the other facilities it works out as the most expensive WiFi I’ve ever paid for! ROW NYC served purely as a base for our sightseeing stay, but it could’ve been better nevertheless. We plan to visit New York again in the future but we won’t consider this place again. If you’re travelling as a couple of small group of family or friends, I wouldn’t recommend this hotel. There are plenty of others to choose from so shop around. If it’s part of a travel agent package, consider asking for another hotel. Sorry ROW NYC, it just wasn’t great. ",2/18/18,2
"Dont expect too much from this Hotel.The location is close to Times square in the heart of the city.It is a functional hotel,rooms are average.We had a double room in need of a bit of tlc but ok. There is limited eating facilities on site and was incredibly busy for our 4 night stay ",2/18/18,3
"The location is the only good thing about this place...Room was small , dirty and overpricedI would never stay here again it's certainly not value for money ,we were given an upgrade and all I can say if that's one of their better rooms I would hate to see the other ones ",2/17/18,2
"Spent a week at the ROW , nearly 2 years a go, while very basic rooms the location is perfectly situated to see all the main attractions that NYC has to offer. The eateries an computer/ printing facilities the hotel has in offer are certainly very handy. If comparing the quality of rooms to the price you pay to most other cities, well you’d say your over paying, however this is New York so I think considering the location it’s good value and I’m happy enough to be staying there again later this year ",2/17/18,3
"I find it hard to believe that people didn’t enjoy their stay here.We speak as we find. Check in was quick, no queues for us!! We found the reception staff very polite, friendly and helpful, there was a problem with one of our rooms this was sorted the next day and wow did they sort it.. swapped for a room with a city and Hudson River view! Awesome We ate breakfast here every day either in the bar area or in city kitchen we thought the prices were quite reasonable considering the fact that this is New York! Thank you for an incredible stay! ",2/17/18,5
"We have just arrived back from Row NYC. The hotel served it's purpose as a comfy place to put our head in between busy days out exploring. The hotel is in the perfect location for exploring - everything is on its doorstep and we found it really easy to find our way around the city using this as the base. The room was ok. I was expecting it to be tiny based on other reviews so was pleasantly surprised. It was cosy and big enough to get ready in and walk around. We didn't have a bath (not sure if that's the same for all rooms) but that was ok. And there wasn't a kettle for a cup of tea (British request! Lol) however, the drinking water out the cooler was lovely and a nice touch to have this unlimited. My only real criticism of this hotel was the deposit. We had read about the facilities fee so had brought extra cash for this but was disappointed to learn once we arrived they wanted a $250 deposit on top of the fee too (approx $380). For a couple travelling on a budget with no access to a credit card this came as a bit of a shock. We had saved hard for the trip and every penny we had had gone into our spending money. The hotel staff however were empathetic with us and offered to just take $250 including the facilities fee and would refund us the difference at the end of the trip. This was just a minor hiccup for us though and as long as you are prepared with extra cash aside then this is easily overcome. On the whole this was exactly what we paid for a nice, basic, no thrills but comfy base, slap bang in the middle of the city that never sleeps! Thank you for the memories NYC! ",2/17/18,4
"This hotel is in an excellent, central position. The hotel was very busy therefore there was quite a wait to check in and for the elevators. The extra charges were quite high on top of the hotel rate. The rooms were ok, a little on the small side but that's to be expected. I found them a little basic. The maid came in the room both mornings at 7.15, which was a little early ",2/17/18,3
"The bathroom was not cleaned and that was disgusting. It took a long time to check in, at least 20 minutes just for waiting. I wouldn’t recommend staying here as a couple at least, then there’s tons of other places to stay. ",2/17/18,2
"I unfortunately cannot compliment this hotel at all. We arrived Tuesday morning. Tried to check in & had a rude woman deal with it, she told us that we had to pay a security deposit which is fine even though we had no knowledge of this but then to be told they were going to keep the money after for services we didn’t need to use ( calls outside of NY even though I had already paid my phone bill to fit this in for me, a fitness centre on the 3rd floor, WiFi which glitched so wasn’t used, water bottles which you could fill on other floors of the hotel that didn’t help, and other services which we never even needed). I asked the lady politely if we had to pay for those services as we knew we wouldn’t need to use them & I got back a mouthful of attitude on the fact that she didn’t care if we used them or not that is their rules and that’s what we are there to follow. We politely asked why this wasn’t on any paperwork before we had arrived and she then tried to blame our travel agents for this when they also have no knowledge of this as we have already asked but then she proceeded to tell us that it’s the hotel that make those kind of rules so they wouldn’t have known anyway which was my point exactly. So if you pay for this on a card it’s $150. If you pay by cash it’s $250. I had my card to use in an emergency so that was where unfortunately my money went for that. We finally checked in, got to our room which was basic but dirty. The carpet had marks all over it, the heating didn’t work and the air conditioning kept kicking in. The room was dusty, the drawers and side boards were sticky & it just looked like it needed a good, deep clean, there was someone else’s hair down the side of the bed and dust all down the back & on the head board. We left our things & headed out.The next day we didn’t receive clean towels or clean bedding both were which dirty & used. The bathroom was also dirty, the bath had marks in it from the day we checked in & the unit where the sink sits had clump fulls of dust either side. Our room hadn’t been hoovered either so I’m not sure what the cleaning policy of each room exactly is but it definitely isn’t up to a healthy standard. Our room was freezing each evening and especially not ideal when you suffer with bad asthma and need to get into a warmer room after being outside the whole day it was uncomfortable at the coldness. I went to bed in more layers than I went outside exploring in. The evening before we were checking out a female staff member was creating a scene near the lifts and shouting at a gentleman telling him how rude he was and how he needed to leave ( I understand it’s hard to work somewhere that you can become a target for receiving backlash at times ) but doing it in front of customers and then shouting at your co workers because they were not aware of the situation and allowed the gentleman to proceed to move around near the bar isn’t a welcoming situation for people who were walking around. Over all the hotel and the policies are shocking and when we return to New York we won’t be staying here. Sadly the only positive I can give Row NYC Hotel is the location. ",2/17/18,1
Stayed here for 4 nights this February with 3 other people in one room with 2 double beds. Room has everything needed and isn't too small but definitely could do with a bit of updating in the decorating as it was rather worn. We were on floor 11 and had a view which was ok nice not to be just looking at a wall. The lift system is a bit tricky to get your head around to start with but once you realise the concept is a lot easier than stopping at all the floors so good idea shame the lifts are so small. Hotel staff very accommodating they found us a kettle for the room when we asked and the room was cleaned well everyday with fresh towels and clean floors. The lobby was really busy all the time but there was a bar and shop in the hotel so this is too be expected and you couldn't here any noise from lobby once in room even when there were events happening which there was while we were staying. Make sure you try the food court The Kitchen that's inside the hotel the food was amazing!!!!! And really reasonably priced. Location for everything was great from here walk straight down 8th you get to Central Park walk round the corner Times Square is right there walk to the end of 44th and the intrepid sea air space museum is right there it was perfect location shops right next door food right there and make sure you try the pizza restaurant next door to mac Donald's just down from hotel was top notch food at super low prices. Overall couldn't fault this hotel,2/16/18,4
"It is well located, the bedroom is realy confortable and I loved the experience of being in the Row. There are nice restaurants around the hotel, and it's pretty close of the Times Square and Broadway ",2/16/18,5
"I stayed here last night as a late Valentine’s Day celebration. This is dirtiest hotel I’ve ever stayed at. (Refer to pictures below)Second, their service is probably the worst I’ve ever experienced. Front desk and concierge desk do not pick up the phone. EVER. I think I called them at least 50 times. In the end this is the worst hotel I’ve stayed in and would not recommend anyone stay here. ",2/16/18,1
"It is easy to slate hotels for minor issues but I like to say I am consistent across my reviews. So what about the ROW then.I have to say I really liked the hotel. We arrived on a Saturday night and it was absolutely belting down with rain. We got the Newark express bus and it left us at port authority. As it was raining we were flustered and ended up going downtown to 41st before we turned around and found the row. Literally get off the bus turn left and go up two streets. Check in was a breeze, the hotel staff member was dealing with “complaining guests” and he was delighted when we gave him a box of celebrations for the staff. He then said he would get us an upgrade. He got us a city view room away from the lifts. Where we totally blown away with the room- No, was it what we expected -yes. Small enough room king bed, small wardrobe and two small bedside cabinets. If I had one issue , some more drawers or hanging space would be nice. Tv with 99 channels. Bathroom nice size and clean and nice toiletries. shampoo and conditioner , 2 types of solid soap and body lotion.The walls of the room are like paper and the doors slam, if you have manners you close the door easy and speak lower. We had a joining door in our room and our neighbours did not have manners and slammed the door all the time and forgot we could hear “ everything” lol. The lifts can be a pain, you type in your floor number and it allocated a lift. In the mornings it can be difficult to catch a lift and we walked the sixteen floors a few times. Cleaning staff really nice and friendly.Bit disappointed that the hotel bar was taken over a few nights for fashion shows and events. City kitchen nice but expensive.Row is so close to Times Square and a subway across the street is so handy. My advice though the McDonald’s right by the hotel is full of homeless people and can be slightly uncomfortable and it was shut for hygiene reasonsLittle convenience store at the lifts is quite cheap and has a good selection.We went to a few nice places to eat and found the mean fiddler the best. Check out is 12:00 and no pressure from the staff. I used the gym and quite small but really clean. About 6 treadmills , 4 bikes 3 cross trainers only two weight benches and three machines. Really nice area for free internet and printing boarding passes. We stayed 6 nights and paid 30 dollar a night resort fee, annoying but that is USA for you.In summary, did I like the row. YESWould I stay again - yesDid I see better located hotels -yesI think it was a nice hotel at a nice price. But if you want dust free perfect hotel stay elsewhere and pay five times the price ",2/16/18,5
"Awesome, the wait for elevators were ridiculous in the morning afternoon hours. The rooms were extremely cold with no instructions on how to use the thermostat.the rooms were clean and cozy. Nice location in the heart of time square and the prices were extremely affordable ",2/15/18,5
"Great place to stay when visiting New York!! Everything walking distance and hotel basically on the door of time squareRooms are basic and quite small but was ok for us as we only slept here and were out all day and night. WiFi is great here Bar not great v pricey $10 for a beer in a plastic cup!! DO NOT get stung when checking in by lads beside reception - offering free breakfast, bus rides.. it’s a con to get you to a time share meeting and can cost you $40 dollars ",2/15/18,3
"Row hotel attended my expectations. Despite of a small room, they are placed just one block from Time Square and and close to lots of good restaurants. If we return to New York, we will probably stay there again ",2/15/18,4
"Check in speedy - held £200 on card & you need to play $172 for taxes, WiFi etc. Staff- not many staff about- the ones that were looked awfully grumpy. The maids were lovely & also the kind man on the door.Man on check out (looked like a manager) didn’t seem bothered- not so much as a goodbye or thank you. Hotel- we came in fashion week apparently- nice bar area cornered off most of the time for fashion shows etc. Experienced some rude ‘models’ that though they could do as the wish. Location- can’t beat it! Close to everything you need. Rooms- decent view, heating we couldn’t turn off, dirty bathrooms & a sliding door with no privacy. Would definitely stay again but only due to location ",2/15/18,3
First of all when I got there to check in I must have waited 25 minutes to be taken care of even though nobody else was being checked in. I was supposed to have a deluxe room with a city view and it was more like a standard room with a view of an empty lot and parking lot next to that. The bed was so uncomfortable by the second day my back was stiff and could not even bend over to tie my shoes. I wanted to leave my bags since my flight was later that afternoon and I got the run around of where to leave them. When I went to pick up my bags instead of taking the regular elevator to the 2nd floor I had to take the service elevator and still wait to get my bags since no one was there to attend to the people. The worst stay I have ever experienced at a hotel!,2/15/18,1
"I stayed with The Row in 2015 and had a fairly pleasant stay and so back in Sept 2017 I booked another stay for 4 nights this month (Feb 2018). I have been receiving regular email communications from the hotel re: things like adding rewards and upgrades, which we decided to opt for if they were available.At 9am on the morning of the first day of our stay, I got a notification from Amex that the hotel charged a pre-authorization amount to my credit card, which was expected. I received another email from them at 3:30pm about checking-in online. I tried to check-in online while we were at the Toronto airport a few hours later, but received an error. Our flight from Toronto to NYC was delayed, and so about 10 minutes before boarding our flight (around 8pm) I thought it might be a good idea to call the hotel and give them the courtesy of letting them know we'd be arriving later than expected. The woman on the phone was kind but told us ""Unfortunately I have some bad news - your reservation has been canceled and we're fully booked."" She couldn't tell me who canceled the reservation nor why it was canceled. I just know that I definitely didn't cancel it and so we we're left stranded by The Row. I'm guessing that they'd overbooked the hotel and honestly just didn't care that they'd screwed us over. Thankfully I was able to book another hotel on my phone while we were on our flight but The Row completely ruined that night for us. I can see from other reviews that this unexplained cancellation situation is a common occurrence. Sorry, I mostly enjoyed my stay in 2015 but I'll never book The Row again ",2/15/18,1
We lasted five minutes in this dump and that was five minutes too much as we could have been out in this amazing city. We checked straight back out and found another hotel to stay in (Distrikt) I advise you to do the same! Room allocated was scruffy and dated with what looked like beer/pop sprayed up the door and walls. We had left a swipe of a card at check in and the hotel have charged this for use of facilities. We only used the lift up and then back down! The hotel had a “unique” smell and could really be described as a youth hostel. Reception staff had a couldn’t care less attitude! They must be used to the complaints.,2/15/18,1
"Surprisingly good. Not hemmed in by tradition, but everything is just right in a ""I never thought of that"" kind of way. Our room was small, but who is looking for that on a trip to Broadway/Times Square. Spacious bathroom, and very clean. The staff was delightful and genuinely interested. Unexpected surprises at every turn. And did I mention it was cheap too? ",2/15/18,5
great bar tenders Jarret Rania and zakaria and Aniza are super awesome and very professional they know there stuff when it comes to drinks infact i love coming to the bar instead of going to other bars in New york city the atmosphere is great and the entertainment is awesome .ps best bar and staff in New York city,2/14/18,5
This is our second visit and it just as good as the 1st stay! Room is reasonable size (Ada room) checking in was easy!! The rooms are clean comfy! And location is amazing! Def book again!! The hotel always smells amazing when you walk in! The WiFi is great speed,2/14/18,5
What a great experience! Enjoyed every single thing about this Hotel! I will definitely stay here every time I visit NYC! The rooms are huge compared to other NYC rooms. It was clean and trendy. Loved the water stations and water bottles. Very cool and enjoyed my stay very much,2/14/18,5
This was an unfortunate experience. I would not stay in this hotel again. Pros:- Room was clean and decent in size (2 beds)- extremely convenient locationCons:- Our shower floor was broken and when you stood on it you almost fell over. It felt like standing on a water bed. There was water that somehow got beneath the lining and was moving all around while you were trying to stand there. - VERY long wait times to get luggage and check in - Many angry customers were in line and in arguments about whatever it was they were unhappy abou,2/14/18,3
"The ROW is not only at a prime location, but also offers prime service. Its staff is very friendly, attentive, and helpful. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. Stayed here already twice and will definitely return to the ROW upon my next trip to NY. Don't look around, but stay at the ROW ",2/14/18,5
"Well, it’s in a great location if you’re visiting the theater district, Times Square, Broadway and close to the subway. Plenty of restaurants and shops. The rooms are kind of modern style, but very very smaller and crammed. View from room 1257. ",2/14/18,4
Good value for money considering it's in such a fantastic location. Family room adequate for 2 adults and 2 young kids. Everything you need but nothing extra. Tea/coffee making in room would be nice. Would recommend to others considering the location,2/14/18,3
"no words can describe this terrible establishment. Service was bad, hotel filthy, the only upside is the location, otherwise I wouldn't even bother staying there and it's not even cheap.i have travelled extensively in my life and this is probably one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in ",2/14/18,1
"Everything about this hotel was exceptional. The location, quality/cleanliness of the room and the staff as a whole were phenomenal. We were at the bar each of our 4 nights and Jarret, Raina and Zaichria were all very friendly, funny and made incredible drinks. Definitely made our stay that much better ",2/13/18,5
"The bartenders, Jarret, Rania and Zakaria were awesome! Super friendly and great to chat with :) The drinks and food are very tasty. Would 100%recommended staying at this hotel or at least stopping by the bar ",2/13/18,5
"Absolutely disgusting hotel. A broken toilet, dirty plastic cups provided, hardly any hot water (have to let it run for atleast 15 minutes before hand) each night at least one of our cards that has access to the hotel doesnt work, the lift takes sooo long before you can even get in it to get to your floor (that's after the staff have treated you like a bum telling them to show your room key before you can go near the lift. They couldn't even provide a pen that works so we could just ask the cleaner to leave some clean cups. The service person they sent to our room to fix the hot water was so rude and tried telling us how to turn a tap on (seriously, were Australian - not idiots). All of this on out honeymoon and unfortunately they won't even give us our $ back to go elsewhere, I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL. 0 STARS ",2/13/18,1
"Enjoyed our stay, Jarret at the bar after we ordered our initial drinks was there to advise and make cocktails! Couldnt wish for more and made the experience a great one! All round happy with our experience and we will be returning, and the beds are comfy and room clean! Lo ",2/13/18,5

"Super location, clean, great value. Stayed 5 nights! The building is historic and mod in its own unique way. Near subways, theatre, times square. Loved the stay. I would stay here again. It is also close to central park for walks and runs. Staff was very helpful ",2/13/18,5
"We have stayed at The ROW (formerly the Milford Plaza) many times over the years. The hotel is definitely better after the previous renovation. Rooms are clean and reasonable size, for a NYC hotel. Lounge is convenient and comfortable place to spend down time. City Tavern provides an eclectic variety of eateries. Best of all 8th & 45th is wonderful location for theaters. ",2/13/18,5
"Good location in NY but even on the 13th floor the traffic disrupted our sleep. We were supposed to have been upgraded but fail to see how that was an upgrade, unless it was the view up eight avenue but did not include any landmark. Very small rooms and not that comfortable with a very noisy Air Con unit that when turned off allowed noise from outside in. Certainly a city that doesn't sleep. Few facilities in the room. Common areas supposed to be dark and trendy but mostly felt a little oppressive and basically ugly if not a little seedy. Watch out for the larger than normal additional charges on the rooms for facilities that you almost certainly won't even find, never mind use. Included a WiFi but this was poor. Overall the extras fee was a rip off. Always a long queue for the desk so it was pointless waiting to make a complaint. Wouldn't stay here again ",2/13/18,2
The staff was very friendly and kind. I felt VERY safe and comfortable since they check for hotel keys before you get on an elevator. The location was amazing and the room was nice and the view was cool. The woman at the front desk was funny and made sure to give us the best that she could!! :,2/12/18,5
"I stayed at Row NYC because a friend recimmended it. It's a very good hotel, well located, good service, excellent staff. Wish it to have breakfast included at the hotel rate, which was a little high for not offering breakfasf ",2/12/18,4
"I have been to ROW NYC four times now over the past two years. Each and every time we go there, it seems to improve. We go in to see a show each year around this time. As you walk in the staff are friendly and you immediately feel safe. They will watch out for you. The access to the hotel is up some stairs which at first blush you might think is a hassle (especially if you have luggage) but it is actually a positive because no one travels up there that doesn't belong there.The lobby at first is a bit dark and a couple of years ago would remind you of the inside of a subway station. But over the past two years, you can tell that there is an attention to detail and now what looked like a subway resembles clean lines and NY chic décor. Simple but crisp and efficient which is what this hotel is. There was no line at the lobby area at check in and it was well staffed. Technology abounds to help NY travelers.The rooms are clean and well appointed. Simple lines but crisp linens, comfortable beds and a feeling like the staff cares about the cleaning process. You can almost envision that they use a checklist to make sure all bases are covered. Efficient and the pricing is right for NYC. The elevator technology is impressive and such a welcome little perk. TIme that it takes to get to your floor is minimal and the whole system is very organized to handle the number of people coming and going. The District M lounge had a great selection of drinks and while we did not eat there we did enjoy watching the Olympics on their wall size TV.As I read the reviews, I do not understand others experience when they say it is unfavorable Personally I think (having stayed at other NYC hotels in this price range) this is the best kept secret in NYC! ",2/12/18,5
"It was my second stay at ROW NYC. The location is excellent, it's a theatre district. I would recommend it to those who are theatre-goers. The room was clean, but rather small. The service was very good. If I go to New York once more, I'll stay at this hotel ",2/11/18,4
"Ideal location but the room was very basic. Staff weren’t the friendliest and hard to deal with at times. We got charged $100 security fee without being told about, only found out when checking my bank account before checking out. The bill at the end wasn’t very clear either. ",2/11/18,3
the hotel is in the best location for Times Square and broadway shows---there are lots of choices for food nearby and nightlife---the hotel workers are friendly and courteous and offer great suggestions upon request---there are several food choices within the hotel along with a lounge with live music where you can sip a drink and cruise the free wifi---highly recommend based on price and location --perfect for single or business travel and couples--I will be bac,2/11/18,5

"I arrived at 9 am and took a huge line to do a previous check in. Almost 40 min. I arrived at 16 h to check in and there was again a huge line. I took more 30 min in line. The check in desk was always crowded with only 2 or 3 employees. At the moment of booking Row hotel offers 3 vouchers / promotions. Careful. I was not able to use the discount for NY City Pass and I was not able to use other discount. Nobody helps you about that, but they ""sold"" it as an ""advantage"". ",2/11/18,2

"What can I say, yet again great service from The Row. Prior to our trip I had spoke Many times to Stephanie who was great to deal with, very quick at replying to emails and hugely helpful. Checked in today, very quick. Nelly was on the front desk and she was lovely. Very helpful and happy. Exactly the type of greeting that makes you feel good when checking in. The first room we had was a little on the small side but a quick pop down to the front desk and Nelly changed us to the same type of room we had on our last visit. This was done so easily, no waiting around and Nelly really couldn’t have been any better. She was fantastic. Room is very clean, modern and spacious. The view is also amazing!! This is only our first night of a 6 night stay and we are delighted to be back at The Row. Attached a few pics of our view :- ",2/10/18,5

"Overall, everything was satisfactory. I really appreciated having the availability of the various eating options in the City Kitchen right on the hotel premises. The rooms are small but adequate.

We only stayed 2 nights would not have wanted to stay any longer .On the 1st day I left my phone on the hop on hop off bus . I went to the reception staff and ask if they could ring the bus company for me and was told no as we had not used the bus company they use which costs a lot more . The next day we were locked out of our room as we were on 22nd floor not easy we were told a mistake had been made they thought our room had not been paid for .It happened again that evening we were told we had to show out passports well that was difficult as they where in safe in our room .Not a good time was had,2/9/18,3

Minutes from Time Square and Restaurants added to the benefits of staying here ",2/9/18,4
"Jose and Jared were so accommodating and friendly. Coming to NY can be intimidating, so having kind and attentive service at the first bar we sat down at was really special. This bar is lucky to have these two barmen ",2/9/18,5
Just arrived back from a 5 night stay in New York. The hotel check in is very smooth and very modern. I chose this hotel as it was one of the few that offered twin beds. Ideal location. The 2 reasons I'm not giving 5*'s are the fact the walls are quite thin and we could hear a lot of noise some nights. And......almost $18 for a glass of wine in the hotel bar is ridiculous!,2/8/18,4
Quick check-in. Quick attention to a heating issue - upgraded to another room immediately. Convenient to CITY KITCHEN restaurant with excellent food. District M bar and food service was great as always,2/8/18,4
"The overall experience of this hotel was very good, the location was amazing, a 2 minute walk to the centre of Times Square, the facilities were brilliant, The City Kitchen and Sugar Factory in the hotel is a must! The only downside was that we tried to change rooms as ours wasn’t as clean as we had hoped and did smell a bit funky but they wanted to charge us extra per night which we couldn’t afford, we settled for the room we were given and did have a very pleasant stay. I would definitley recommend. ",2/8/18,4
I have stayed at this hotel 3 times. I have a convention at Time Square every February. I love the cool vibe of the halls and the rooms. The room is small but decorated and clean and feels so inviting for someone traveling alone that needs a comfortable resting spot for the night.,2/8/18,4
"I spent a six nights in the hotel. Upon check in I upgraded to a bigger room (than the standard room) as was quite satisfied with a high floor corner room that had a view of Time Square. The rooms are basic, but covers everything a traveler needs, a decent bed, small desk, wifi that worked and a bathroom. Water pressure in the bathroom was not very good, enough for a shower, but not great. Design and furnishings very basic, but given the rate, a good value. You are charged extra for the wifi and free calls (local and international), which is a bit annoying as it should be all included in the rate up front ",2/8/18,4
"ROW NYC is a good 3 star tourist hotel located close to Times Square. The rooms are quite small but renovated. They have one bar/restaurant. They charge an additional fee, facility fee for the use of the extra's. This includes the use of the wifi. They advertise with free wifi, but it is included in the additional service fee of $30 per day. So it is a bit misleading. Therefore you have to be aware that the costs of this hotel are considerable more than advertised on the booking sites. They should include those costs in the reservation or make it optional. Let the hotel guest decide ",2/8/18,3
I stayed with friends and it was a nice experience. The rooms are small but functional. The best thing on this hotel is the location. The staff was really nice with us. The only issue was the cleaniness. But overall it is Ok,2/7/18,4
"Awful staff, they are rude if you are young don’t bother going to this hotel. The bar staff deliberately ignore you. Also the rooms displayed look “big” they are absolutely tiny.Oh if you go to the concierge make sure you get a second opinion because they tell you the wrong information. If you don’t buy from them they don’t want to know. Make sure you bring a lot of money to tip because they literally tell you give me a tip ",2/7/18,3
"Nice hotel, value, location, great staff . I do not like the $30+ “for no reason charge” on top of your room fee. No other place in NY charges this. I was also told that parking would be $45, and it was $70+ ",2/7/18,5
"As my title above states, great price great location, clean and what is expected for a four star hotel in New York City. Not a bad word to say about row nyc. Can only recommend it! If I was to go back I would stay again. ",2/7/18,4
Stayed here for 4 nights at the end of January and would happily return. Hotel is in a great location and very handy for Times Square and Broadway. Staff were friendly. Room was clean and was big enough for what we needed it for. Happy customer,2/7/18,4
Our room at Row needed some attention. There was missing veneer from the closet and a footprint that looked like tar in the middle of the carpet. The doormen and security were pleasant and we liked the automated check-in by I-pad at reception and the fast elevators.We encountered very rude and unprofessional service in the bar on the night of January 25. They seemed clueless and poorly trained.,2/7/18,3
"A dowdy, dingy looking hotel - very noisy in the evenings. No beverage making facilities, food area very pricey. Water and ice available but long way from room to collect.The one plus was it is very central - we've used cheaper and found them better ",2/7/18,2
"We did the valet parking package, fantastic! Easy drop off and pick up of car. Receptionist was amazing quick and friendly, hotel location great to see all the sights! Room clean and perfect for our one night stay! ",2/7/18,4
"small room , very busy hotel , arrived in the room late where temp was set on 78 degrees , therefore did not sleep , and when got up to take a shower ...no hot water !!! brilliant !! did get moved to another room slightly bigger but no commercial gesture at all....oh yeah and the bill was soeved under the door of the room at 8:00am the day of departure ....(ie : plse get out...! ",2/7/18,2
"Staff was friendly and helpful. Best thing ever is the attached City Kitchen, a reasonably priced and designer food court. Perfect for grabbing and go to room after a long day. Hipster grunge look decor to hallways. My room had a queen bed and was small yet comfortable. An extra blanket was brought on request. Bathroom products of good quality. No shower caps. Great location on Eighth Ave near all the Broadway theatres. I was happy with my stay. No complaints. I would stay here again ",2/7/18,4
This is not a luxury hotel but it is one block from Times Square and Restaurant Row. All of the Broadway shows are within walking distance. The lower floors need upgrading but the rooms are clean and secure. There is a nice Bar in the lobby where you can order a light meal before the show. The subway is less than a block away giving you access to all of Manhattan. I would definitely recommend this hotel,2/6/18,4
There are so many other hotels that offer better service for the price. Air conditioning/heating system very loud and kept us up all night and cycled between hot and cold...no happy medium. Breakfast options are good but they shut down for an hour to switch to lunch. Would have been nice to know this ahead of time.,2/6/18,2
If you’re looking for a place with easy walking distance to time square and Broadway and this is a great location. The hotel seems tired and in need of a good cleaning. Stopped in at district am for a nightcap and was completely ignored by the servers. And there were probably only eight other guests ther,2/6/18,3
"I'd read up on some of the reviews of the hotel prior to visiting and was a little bit wary beforehand but my goodness, I was absolutely astounded by how pleasant it actually was! All of the staff we came across were so helpful and friendly, and it was interesting to find out about how historical the building was too. Myself and my sister loved City Kitchen, which I highly recommend (especially DOUGH! ), and we couldn't fault the place. A great base for exploring Manhattan and we will most definitely return. Thanks a bunch :D - The green and pink haired ladies from Newcastl ",2/6/18,5
"Room was ready early which was a nice surprise, we felt comfortable in our room , beds very comfortable although maybe not up to as high of a standard as far as cleanliness as I would have liked. The room wasn’t filthy just well used and a bit tired. Most definitely wouldn’t put me off staying again, just stuff you would expect of a slightly older room. ",2/6/18,4
The place is excellent except the added resort fee Daily essentially for nothing. Security at night is professional and taken seriously. Great location. Easy checking . Many restaurants in the area. Recommended.,2/6/18,4
"Great place to stay and location everything is close by. Their breakfast is excellent. (City Kitchen inside The Row check it out, (eg. Dough and Lukes lobsters you would not regret it. Our favorite place to stay when in town is the Row. Employees make you feel at home ",2/6/18,5
"POSITIVE: Beds, food court (great) staff, elevators, locationNEGATIVE: Sound (bathroom door slides, not soundproof - neither are walls), noisy lobby w/ barAll in all, for the price (not inc. NYC taxes) a value ",2/6/18,3
"The room smelt awful, the check-in people were rude, and the over charged us even though we paid last month in advanced to book the room since they said it was non-refundable. I will not be staying at this hotel ever again, also we had to pay for parking which is wrong because we are already paying for the hotel they should give a voucher for parking. This experience for my first time sleeping at the row was not well, and my husband agrees. They did not even do a military discount which was disappointing because a lot of hotels do to honor our active duty members. ",2/6/18,1
"Room was $105CDN a night. Thought it was a good deal. Got charged $34 extra a night for a resort fee. This was nonsense. We didn't use the gym or half of the services this ""resort fee"" covered. We ended up paying an additional $135 CDN extra for our stay. ",2/6/18,3
"Great location near Times Square. Fully renovated hotel. Modern but cozy, with a great food court (City Kitchen) and a bar with Live music some nights (District M). Direct subway line from and to JFK, just two blocks from Port Authorit ",2/6/18,5
"I looked at reviews for hotel and thought id made a mistake in booking it. But i was wrong. All the staff i met were friendly and proffesional, i never waited more than a few minutes at the reception. The same for the lifts always within a few seconds. The heating and air con in the room worked well. If i had to provide a negative then yes the rooms are on the smaller side and prehaps a lick of paint here and there. But what do you expect for that type of $ in that perfect location. ’would def rebook ",2/6/18,5
"I was a little hesitant booking this hotel after reading the reviews. My husband and I spent little time in the hotel or room as we were out seeing New York City. The room was clean and stocked with everything we needed. It was small, but that didn’t matter. We needed a place to sleep and shower and this was perfect. The location is also awesome. Short walk to Times Square and easy to get anywhere we needed to go. Definitely recommend and we would stay again! ",2/5/18,5
I stayed at the ROW a few weeks back for business. Hotel was very nice! Staff was very helpful and friendly. Good hotel if visiting NYC. Close to attractions + easy walk to the Park. Room was clean and again the hotel staff could not have been nicer. Recomend to all,2/5/18,5
"This was one if the cheapest hotels and for the location it was a good price! The rooms are small but we were upgraded on reception so we didn't find them that small. Cleanliness was fine and maids very polite, always gave what you asked for and was done daily! There was noise from the room next door and I couldn't get through to an actual person on the phone after trying for some time....if the halls were even patrolled by security after say 11pm this may have ceased and been helpful! The heating system omg the loudest thing in the world and right next to where you sleep not up high as normal...we turned it off alot but it was set by temp so would kick in all through the night...tbh after a day there you sleep through anything you're that tired though ",2/5/18,3
"I was scared after booking when my wife read me all the reviews about the hotel on Facebook. I was expecting feces on the bathroom floor , dirty sheets etc. This was not the case - very clean, friendly staff and an easy experience. We visited just before Xmas and it was great - perfect location for our tri ",2/5/18,5
"Excellent location, very clean, towels changed daily, nothing is too much trouble, bar area is lovely and food exceptional. Perfect choice of hotel even the trip's pick up at this hotel, the higher floor is a good choice we were on 26th Floor with amazing views ",2/5/18,5
"Having stayed at several hotels in the same area for 14 years at around the same price I thought it would be a similar spec. The room was a third of the size, even the receptionist said it was a “teeny tiny” room when questioned that it was advertised as a Superior Room. It was two single beds as opposed to two double beds. We had no hot water a couple of days and it was a charcoal grey in colour. The bathroom needed a good scrub and very dusty along with the bedroom. There was no where to put your cases so had to put them on the bed to be able to move around the room and the air con woke you up every time it came on. This would normally anger me but it was also a 21st birthday present for my daughter so I am very disappointed ",2/4/18,1
"Great location for Midtown NYC. Close to theaters, restaurants, movies, shopping and business. They do supply a refrigerator if needed for your stay. For quick breakfast, lunch and dinner there is a food court on the premises ",2/4/18,5
"ROW nyc is located a couple of blocks from Times Square, and near several theaters. The prices are reasonable; there's an option for free breakfast ( well, it's called ""the $1 breakfast ""). The decor is modern and colorful. I've stayed there twice and will certainly reserve there again if I need to be in Manhattan. ",2/4/18,5
"I stayed only for one night. It's a 3* hotel so can't compare it to great hotels but I've also seen other 3* hotels in Manhattan that were better to my opinion. This hotel felt very hip when entered, lively bar area with music and people.The room was very small. very. however they had a bathtub which I appreciate and was much needed so I loved that. I have to say the bath is very nice and was more than expected.The room was clean, comfortable bad. good heating though it was noisy. heard also some noise from the hall but not too terrible. free wi-fi though not strong signal.No room service as far as I found.an o.k hotel, young and chik oriented ",2/4/18,3
"The rooms are tiny. The hallways are dark. The music is LOUD. The front desk help is slow, super slow. It's on a very crowded street, tourists are everywhere, clueless and the only fun I had was trying to identify all the different languages I heard being shouted in the lobby. Avoid this place if you can ",2/4/18,2
The lobby had a lot of character and the staff was very sweet. The room itself was what I had a problem with. I paid for a Deluxe Suite and the room was smaller than every hotel I have ever stayed in. Right off the bat I looked around and there was trash in the drawers from the previous guest which made me believe they didn’t clean the room well. I went to shower and there was still soap from when they had been cleaning it. I had to let the shower run to rinse out the tub. I felt like I was staying in a 1 bedroom apartment. Only good thing was it was in the middle of where I wanted to be but so were a bunch of other hotels.,2/4/18,3
Stayed here for my 30th birthday had a great time everything went smoothly check in was quick and I was lucky to have a room upgrade as it was my birthday everyone was friendly even the chaps who kept our bags It was great leaving my bags be safe with them would definitely return here and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to anyone wanting to got to nyc thanks row nyc hope to stay with u again soon,2/4/18,5
"I recently stayed at The Row NYC as part of a package deal, with this in mind, I cannot comment on what the hotel actually cost.On arrival, my first impression of the hotel was that it was very modern and ""hip"" with an impressive lobby. Check in was easy and staff were okay. Other than check in, we didn't really have much contact with staff.Our room was adequate, it had everything we required and was warm (which was good considering it was December), it was however done on the cheap. Depsite the modern lobby the rooms are shabby and need a touch up. As the bathroom had no window or ventilation it was starting to get mouldy.The location was perfect, not far from Time Square and hand to get both uptown and downtown.The hotel may have been a small part of our package cost and if it was, then the hotel was good. If it was a big part of the package then the rooms need some TLC ",2/4/18,3
"I have been staying at room 2513 , i have had the worst experience ever for staying at a hotel , first it os saying that the property is 4 stars however it was the same same quailty as reserving at an inn 2nd i ordered some stuff online via amazon the hotel charged me for receiving my package $10 however it didnt stay for even a night ,3rd while i made the reservation online the price was including taxes and fees , over there the hotel charged me extra $190 which they said it was said that it was not included in the online feesI can see only dishonesty and a price that is not equal to what it offers as well as the hotel take the attention of the people by its low price and after they arrive they steal your moneyYou overall very bad experienc ",2/4/18,1
The Row is such a nice establishment. Even if you’re not here at the hotel for accommodations be sure to drop by the adjoining bar District M! The cocktails are just as good as the tenders and servers. :),2/2/18,5
Hi just returned from NYC stayed at the Row Times Square was worried about previous reviews I had read but we found this hotel to be great location also staff very helpful we asked for a high. Floor away from the lifts and had a great room on the 21 st floor the Market place food court was great for breakfast and the Doughnut counter was great people where coming in on their way to work and buy boxes a time bar area good too this was our 9 th time in NYC and would definitely stay here again. also security in this hotel was good they would ask to see your room card at the lifts so that was a good sign no one was walking in of the street,2/2/18,5
not worth the money I can stay at a cheaper hotel and have the same service. no maid service one day called for them just to bring towels and it took one and a half hours for that to come and we missed our dinner reservations. great location but I'd rather stay somewhere else and walk a little farther to the shows and dinner.,2/2/18,3
"Great location, checking in and out was super fast.it's a very good value for a 3-star hotel, and an above avg value for a 4 star, should be rated as a 3-star hotel in my mind. Rooms are very small, and there no on acoustic separation from other rooms ",2/2/18,4
"Got ""upgraded"" and the room looked worse than the standard doubles online. Walls are paper thin could hear conversations from the room next door. Noise from traffic and road works kept us up all night ",2/2/18,1
"The location of this hotel is amazing 1 block from Times Square and 1 block from subway, but the general maintenance of the whole building needs looking at, rooms are clean but not maintained at all, great views of Nyc from the windows but little things will end up annoying you such as broken lights or rattling radiators ",2/1/18,3
"Had to ask several times for assistance, 3 separate issues. Toilet paper was less than one roll for 3 people staying 2 nights. Window was broken open. Also had to ask twice for towels. Employees downstairs were friendly ",2/1/18,3
"This hotel’s location can’t be beat! It’s central to everything as far as shows, shopping, dining, and sightseeing! It’s an older hotel so the rooms are small and feel a little dirty, but the bathroom seems to be renovated as well as the hotel lobby. City Kitchen located right above the lobby has an excellent food court and Free WiFi ",2/1/18,4
"Stayed at the Row hotel on 8th Avenue, a strange and different hotel, rather trendy with a lot of young people gathering in the lobby. Room rather small, yet clean with daily change of linen and towels. No tea/coffee making facilities available. Staff very helpful and nice. It's situated in a very busy area, with a lot of bars and restaurants about. ",2/1/18,3
Great location just once street over from Times Square and pretty handy to the cheaper restaurants in the city. Not overly clean but by no means unliveable. We did not spend a lot of time in the room as we spent most of our time there sightseeing and enjoying the city of New York so for somewhere just to lay you're head at night this place is fine. Would have been nice to have had the facilities fees explained to us on our arrival rather than getting a $156 bill slipped under our door on our last night as a horrible surprise. Rather steep if you ask me considering what the hotel actually offers as included with these fees. Overall an OK hotel,1/31/18,3
The rooms are dirty and not well cleaned. The bed is full of dust and little hair. The toilet is full of hair in the tub and the sink. It's disgusting and definitely don't recommend it to any friend or family.,1/31/18,1
"Hotel is in a great location. Staff were really helpful, especially Christina on reception & the young bar man who helped us very much. Room was cleaned daily & comfortable. I was surprised at how quiet the rooms were considering it was so busy. I’d recommend this hotel to everyone ",1/31/18,5
Recently visited the hotel with my wife. The check in process was very quick and convenient. We visited the bar where we greeted by to beautiful young bartenders. They offered great conversation and made impeccable cocktails. Just want to say thank you Jared and Rena.,1/31/18,5
"We had a great stay at The Row! Staff were helpful and friendly. Lobby and restaurant areas are modern and clean. Great range of food choices morning noon and evening ! We upgraded our room to a larger room, it was still very small but perfect for chilling out in after a long day of sightseeing. Would definitely return to this hotel. ",1/31/18,4
"The hotel had an extremely good location. Both the lobby and cafe were super modern, always filled with young people. It can be too crowded if you rather stay at a hotel on which only guests have access to the premises.The rooms were clean, with clean sheets. But it could be better. It seemed they changed the sheets and towels only and that’s all, but it was acceptable if you have a good rate.The worse part was the house keepers. They were extremely loud since early morning. Despite of the no-disturb signs on the door, they kept laughing and talking to guests and among themselves very loudly, which made close to impossible to sleep after 8 ",1/31/18,4
"So close to Times Square and loads of great restaurants near by. The room was ready early and we checked in without queuing. Great as somewhere to rest our legs after a long day of sight seeing, highly recommend ",1/31/18,5
"This was my second trip to New York and my first time staying at the Row NYC and it was pretty amazing. The hotel is lovely, very chic and trendy and the staff was very nice and helpfull. I loved the fact that you could do the check in and out from the tablets in the lobby and you could avoid the long lines at the front desk. Also the location is a big bug plus! Overall the experience was very good and when I come back i will def stay there again ",1/31/18,5
"I had an extra long layover in NYC and figured I would explore the city while I had the chance. The hotel is very conveniently placed in the heart of Manhattan, about a block from the main strip in Times Square. The hotel staff was very friendly and the rooms, although small, were clean and comfortable. If you are only staying a couple of days, I highly recommend. ",1/31/18,4
Never been spoken to like that and will not pay the amount of money I paid to be in an environment where that is allowed!! Such a disgrace for such a hotel!! You should never allow such behavior and hotel manager didn’t seem interested,1/31/18,3
"This hotel is close to Times Square and that is why it is so expensive. The rooms are extremely dated and need a thorough revamp. Rooms are small and the bathroom is extremely tight. The only thing that saved this hotel from getting a bad review was the beds were extremely comfortable, there is free internet access downstairs (30 minutes) and the reception staff are friendly and the hotel is located in a good area ",1/30/18,3
I can’t stress this enough. Too hot in the room. Heater blew hot air even with thermostat set to off. Location great but don’t think I’d stay again. Especially since I didn’t sleep all night first night due to heat. Couldn’t call to desk because phone was also not working. Was fixed when I asked the next morning. Attentive staff. But heating issue was not completely fixed. No sleep=exhausted. Feel should be compensated for the inconvenience and lack of sleep. Lobby was too hot as well. Bar had limited selection of alcohol. Again the staff was wonderful and location was near Broadway Dance Center which was the reason we were there. Check in was chaos. Not sufficient number of staff members to check people in on a Friday.,1/30/18,3
"My husband and I visited the city for his birthday this location was close to all our planned events in the city. Spacious, clean and comfy room, friendly staff and hassle free check in. It is also very convenient that the food court is located on premises. ",1/30/18,4
"Nice clean room with comfortable bed and sheets. Centrally located in the heart of Times Square. The woodwork needs caulking and painting and the size of the room is small. Other than that, it is a bang for your dollar! ",1/30/18,4
Shopping adventure 2018.. have visited NYC many times and stayed in lots of hotels. This would be the one I would definitely visit again. Staff are lovely. Spacious rooms. Complementary late check out when I asked on my final day.. Great location.,1/30/18,5
"I would definitely stay here again. The hotel and rooms were clean and well maintained. We were within walking distance to all of the sights we wanted to visit. The room was reasonably priced until the extra service fee was added for:-Unlimited Local, Long Distance and International calls - WiFi, unlimited devices - Internet access and printing services in the hotel's iMac Lounge - Eco-friendly, collapsible 16oz. water bottle to use at hotel’s water filtration stations - 24 hour access to the hotel's fitness facility, located on the 3rd floor These were all things that we did not have time for, nor need to use. ",1/30/18,5
"Don’t be fooled by the photos, rooms are tiny! The room and lobby were both dirty, dusty, gross.. door trims looked like they need to be replaced and mold in bathroom. Overall the cleanliness of the lobby and the room was our biggest issue, I can deal with a small room as long as it’s taken care of and doesn’t look like they painted over pounds of dust. I was very disatified with the room. ",1/30/18,2
Location was good...not far off Times Square. Room and bathroom were quiet small. I wouldn’t recommend for more than 2 people. Elevator service was very slow. We often had a wait time of up to 15 minutes.,1/30/18,3
"Had a great stay, best value room in Manhattan. Enjoyed the casual dining and general atmosphere in the hotel, really vibie. Efficient check in and out, friendly and helpful staff. Received restaurant recommendations for restaurant week which were much appreciated ",1/30/18,5
"Good Location, small rooms, bad bar, good food.You can hear what people talk in the others rooms. There' a nice city view. Installations looks modern but rooms look quite old, specially for the bathroom ",1/30/18,4
Hate having hidden fees for stuff you shouldn’t be charged. Like package reception or WiFi. Those should be basic thing for a NY hotel. I paid 150 dolars just for 3 days of WiFi and 1 package reception!!!,1/30/18,2
It wasn’t horrible but it wasn’t great & I wouldn’t go back . Service was very poor never got our room cleaned. I paid for a superior 2 double bed & it was still pretty tight space . The tv remote didn’t really work,1/30/18,3
I loved the location of the hotel. The front desk check in person was very nice and helped with area activities. Room was very modern and bed was comfortable. Only thing the shower didn’t work well. Overall great visit.,1/29/18,5
"This is a fabulous hotel for anyone who wishes to be located in the heart of the Theater District, about a block away from Times Square. It was a 20-30 minute easy walk from Penn Station, and if walking isn’t for you, there’s a subway stop less than a block away. It is literally connected to the Majestic Theater, home of the Phantom of the Opera, and mere minutes away from many other hit Broadway plays. Tons of dining and shopping abounded as well. The room was no frills, but very affordable, and CLEAN—which was the most important thing to me, since I did not plan on spending my time in my room when I had all of NYC to explore. All in all, a great value and a great location ",1/29/18,5
"You cannot beat the location of this hotel. It's close to everything - Times Square and all the Broadway shows, Hell's Kitchen, the subway, City Kitchen, shops, etc. But it's not so close that it's loud or you have bright lights flashing in your room at night.The rooms are small (not as tiny as they could be, but they are very compact). The bed is really comfortable, there is an ok amount of storage for clothes (for 1 person... for 2 people there would be NO room for clothes if you like to unpack). BUT one of my favorite features is that there was a water-filling station on the floor so that I could have clean drinking water before starting our day in the city.The vibe is very fun, and I would really enjoy being there on another solo trip. There were a lot of people, but you really didn't notice it. My room was incredibly quiet.Two other things that I loved: there is a safe in the room and when you need to take the elevator, you punch in your desired floor and it tells you which elevator to take. This helps so that you aren't waiting for an elevator for a long time (at the last hotel I stayed in, some people waited over an hour for an elevator when it was time for check-out). Great feature! 2 things to note (and the reason why it wasn't a 5-rating): The showers were very iffy. The first day, I took a freezing cold shower, and halfway through it the water turned brown. When I called the front desk, they told me just to let the water run. The second and third mornings were better, but I never actually had a hot shower.The line to check in on Friday at 3 PM was really long. I had the option of checking in online ahead of time, but when I tried to do that, it would kick me out of the system at the end.But still, with just those two ""glitches,"" I was happy with the rest of my stay. I also loved that I could safely check my bags with the doorman the last morning so that I could still explore the city until my train left ",1/29/18,4
"we spend few days in row nyc hotel for a short business travel. we find the hotel really good, good value for money, confortable and clean rooms, very good location in nyc close to time square. very friendly staff. see you next tim ",1/29/18,4
"My overall stay was good. I loved the location of the hotel, it made it very convenient to commute to various restaurants and other locations in the area. A few things I didn't care too much for was how much I could hear noise from the room next to me when I was trying to sleep ",1/29/18,4
"The Row is in a great location to get around NYC. We were upgraded for ""free"" to a queen room, which for New York had a lot of room. Only downside is you are told when booking that there is a $25 a night facilities fee, which is fair enough but for whatever reason and one they couldnt seem to explain to us at checkout was that our bill for a 5night stay came to $172.10!?! Staff were rude and not helpful at all. We were basically ushered away from the desk and told to take it up with virgin holidays. Also when you come into the hotel in the evenings there are staff acting as bouncers by the lifts, pretty much every evening i hadnt walked up the stairs to the lifts with my partner i was pulled to one side and asked to show my room key to be allowed into the lift area. This never happened to my partner.So for location its great but there are tons of other hotels all in this area, i know when we go back were be staying elsewhere ",1/29/18,2
"Such an amazing hotel, perfect spot and beautiful rooms helpful and very very nice staff. we came for our anniversary and once I told Robert in the front desk he was so kind that he gave us an upgrade to our room. Believe me Robert is a true Angel.Ask for Robert and you won’t regret it ",1/28/18,5
Great staff / Public common areas well designed with NYC urban vibe / nice connection to Kitchen Market / would return / rooms are small and a little tight for business work / gym is nice / elevator system is pretty well done / great locatio,1/28/18,4
"If you are looking for convenience to theatres, shopping, food & rails this location provides it all. The staff in general are courteous & friendly. While a minimal approach to lodging, logically who needs more than a clean environment & comfortable bed. Both ever present. Than you Row NY ",1/28/18,4
"The location is perfect, the service is great, you can check in before your visit via the internet and just take your key at the self service desk on the reception. Cleanness is good, there is a room service every day. There is a live music show in the bar few days a week. Unfortunately my room was located near the elevators and there always was a noise from them. There was no bathtub in my room, unlike in other rooms. The room was pretty small and the view from the window was on the wall : ",1/27/18,4
I enjoyed my stay here. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly. I would love to go again if I’m staying in the city. Everything you need is right in the hotel lobby ! The rooms were very nice and the bed was very comfortable.,1/27/18,5
"Overall, I had a pleasant experience in this hotel. The central location is perfect; close to Times Square, surrounded by Broadway theaters and places to eat, and has a lively ambiance. The lobby is very fancy, and the rooms did not match the lobby's level of sophistication, but I was satisfied by the quality of the room. The view was incredible, and the size was large enough to be comfortable but not enormous. The room was not very clean though, such as the bathtub, and I did notice a stain on one of the sheets. The staff is friendly, and I also liked the elevator system. If you are visiting New York, I would recommend this hotel ",1/27/18,3
"It was my second time staying at The Row NYC, it ticks all the boxes; great location, attentive staff, clean rooms. I must note the great customer service, in particular Christina S that had excellent recommendations and was very friendly, I'll definitely be back! Thank you ",1/27/18,5
"This was our third stay at Row and unfortunately it will be our last. The hotel is in a perfect location however for the price you pay, it does not live up to expectations. There is no bell service to collect your luggage from the car, the rooms are small and hot, and the food options are really limited. Staff are friendly enough but you don’t feel like you return ‘home’ each day. If you attempt to ring the hotel you get transferred from one person to the next and end up with an answering machine. Maybe as I get older I expect more. Row worked when I was younger, but now I have traveled all over the world, Row misses the mark. ",1/26/18,2
"Hotel located in a very good position, close to Times Square, the underground and the bus station. There are restaurants and live music within the building and seems is a very young and friendly Hotel. However, Rooms are not so big and there was lot of noise and bad smell due to some machines (I do not exactly know what the were); the most annoying thing is the about 30USD per night charged as facilities fees which were not clear when I reserved the room. ",1/26/18,2
"I'll be back next time at this same hotel. Perfectly located in Time Square. Great price, great experience. Zero complaints. It was clean and easily accessible. The hotel staff was very nice. Everything was well kept and professional ",1/26/18,5
"Unfriendly staff; uncomfortable dinning facilities - they provide disposable cutlery instead of proper silverware; dark lights and electronic music at the lobby gives the impression you are at a pub instead of a hotel (), terrible package handling services although they charge for it ",1/26/18,2
"The check in staff were not very friendly. Even though it was our honeymoon and this was mentioned by our travel agent, we got what had to be the smallest room in the hotel (2626) And there were definitely much bigger rooms as I had a look when the doors were left opened by housekeeping. It also had the smallest wardrobe ever so had to put our clothes on the floor and the radiator. Location was convenient and there are PCs with printers in the lobby so you can check in for your flight and print off your boarding pass. ",1/25/18,3
"I would not stay in this hotel again. It is decorated too dark. Wait time in elevators too long. Carpet floors are dirty. Not happy. Cheap hotel. I did not feel safe. Room size was good, clean sheets, no bugs that I could see. Checking in and out can take time. Check in online, but check your statement checking out ",1/25/18,1
Clean room. excelent spot. you do not need use taxi to have tour in Manhattan. Pastry at Sugar factory are great!!!! Market is one of the best idea in NY. Floor 18 really calm. First time: ask for city vie,1/25/18,5
"Great location, nice hotel and good service. It's very close to Times Square and the Theatre District, so you can enjoy these attractions on your own. Subway stations around you and a lot to eat, both expensive and unexpensive. Try it  ",1/25/18,4
"Great Location! Great hotel. What more can I say? Both makes for the perfect vacation and in our case, we were there to celebrate my birthday with a carriage ride through Central Park. Our first time to the ""big apple"" was awesome ",1/25/18,5
"If you're in the city to see theatre and/or museums, the location is terrific. Not a fancy hotel, but certainly adequate. The staff were generally pleasant, particularly at the coffee bar in the morning. The room was comfortably but not spacious ",1/25/18,3
"Had an incredible time in NYC and this hotel was simply perfect. Staff were always prompt and helpful, the hotel had a lovely atmosphere. Gorgeous clean rooms, brilliant sized room. Loved it! Couldn’t have wished for a better hotel for my trip ",1/24/18,5
We had Hamilton tickets and booked Row NYC since we had stayed here previously. The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to everything we wanted to do/see. We found our room to be clean and everyone was quite friendly. This hotel can get very busy but we had no problems checking in and the valet parking was on top of their game. No complaints at all. we look forward to staying at Row NYC later this year when we head back down to see U2,1/24/18,5
"Young couple (21/23) stayed 5 nights during Christmas 22nd-27th 2017.We had a amazing time, cannot fault the hotel at all. Rooms are great for a city break, with ironing board, wifi and hair dryer as extras! Amazing location, out of the way of noise but walking distance from everything. Five minutes from TS, 10 minutes to Rockerfella and 25minutes to Central Park. Amazing!!! We would definitely return to this hotel. ( please try the hotels doughnuts  ",1/24/18,4
"Stayed her with my friend for 4 nights last week. Very central and convenient location. On arrival, we were upgraded to a superior twin room with one of the best views from the window I have ever had! Beds were comfy and made every day, everything worked as it should, towels were clean and fluffy. Facilities fee has recently increased to $32 a night. The internet in the room was always available and has a decent speed. This is obviously a busy hotel with a lot of guests from different backgrounds and nationalities. As such, you got a sense of there being quite a turnaround of rooms. Cleaners were present on corridors every morning and had a lot to do. As such, there were parts of the rooms that weren't very clean (corners of rooms not vacuumed, dusty ledges in the bathroom). I am NOT saying that the rooms were unclean, just that the attention to detail could have been better. As I titled the review, it was great in the way that fast food is great - reliable, quick, good service, but lacking the finesse of fine dining. Of course, this is reflected in the price you pay for a central Manhattan hotel and all adds to what makes it a sound choice.I would recommend this hotel for friends or groups looking for a great location ",1/24/18,4
"IGNORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS - clearly from people expecting far too much for a great bargain price in NYC.We stayed at the Row for 4 nights in January for a short break to New York. From beginning to end we had a superb time at the hotel, we arrived and checked in very quickly to a friendly receptionist who explained everything from how to get to our room, the taxes and fees and also how breakfast worked. we were then off to our room in the very clever and fast lifts, i read reviews on these lifts taking a long time and this is absolute nonsense!! - The room was brilliant and air con made it very easy to control the temp  - bathroom was clean and shower very good temperature and pressure - breakfast was very useful just to grab and go and food hall on site which you pay for had amazing food if you wanted to pay a little extra. - bed was very comfortable - location was simply incredible round the corner from times square and in proximity to subway stations which had lines which could take you to several areas across the city. - check in and check out very fast and easy + ability to leave bags in the hotel on final day was amazingly helpful.- water cooler on our floor was an amazing touch, each night we returned from our travels we could grab some glasses of ice cold water!! Overall i would rate this stay 10/10. Brilliant hotel for the price, comfortable, trendy. friendly and superbly located. Will be staying here again on our next trip to NYC without a doubt, please give this hotel a try for the price and ignore negative reviews from high maintenance guests ",1/24/18,5
"Around the corner from Times Square, it's a prefect spot. Subway is close and walking distance to Madison Square Garden. Rooms are reasonably sized for NYC standards. Check in took nearly 2 hours. Free cookies from down the street are ok but didn't make the line go any faster. Crowded lobby was horrible when trying to walk over people sitting on the stairs and carrying your luggage. The lift takes 10-15 minutes to reach your level so allocated that time when leaving or take the stairs ",1/24/18,3
Excellent stay first time ever great service and location. Stayed on 19th floor nice view. Staff very welcoming. Water available all the time!! (aha I love water). Will be recommending hotel to friends and family,1/23/18,5
"The room was a nice size, could be cleaner I don't like seeing hair in my room. Check in was very slow, they needed more people at the front desk. The location was great, Time square very close by and all of theaters ",1/23/18,3
"Stayed here for one night (for my birthday trip). This hotel is conveniently located near all of the tourist attractions. The room we stayed in was small but it didn't bother us. The room was clean. The only downside of the room was the bathroom was a little dark and could use another light. Bed was a little uncomfortable (but again, it didn't bother us). The staff was very friendly including the security personnel. Bellperson was very friendly and helpful ",1/23/18,4
We needed to call for cups to be brought up to the room 2 nights and the room never was attended by any service also wish the view was alittle better but it was a fun stay my fiancé enjoyed it other then the few issues,1/23/18,4
"This hotel is perfect location wise if you are a tourist like myself, the rooms were basic and fairly clean however behind the bed was covered in dust and rubbish. I had a few bites on my legs and sneezed quite a bit due to this. Check in took forever and the girl did not give us any info when she handed over the key cards ie how to use the lifts or what floor we were on, however the girl did give us free breakfast for inconvenience of how long check in took but this could of been improved. The bar is pricey wouldn’t recommend it however the bar staff are lovely. Also the housekeeping staff lovely. My biggest complaint is the concierge, extremely rude and very unhelpful, does not speak just looks at you and hands you what you need. This is reason the starts arent higher. If this hotel had a touch up it would be a very trendy hotel. I probably wont return due to the level of customer service as i could get better elsewhere i believe ",1/23/18,3
"Rooms are disgusting. Bathrooms are filthy. Rooms are the most filthy rooms I have ever seen of any hotel I have ever stayed in. Pictures are misleading, you don't get what you pay for. Elevators are terrible ",1/23/18,1
"I’m very familiar with the phrase “you get what you pay for,“ however, this wasn’t even worth what we paid for it. The front desk check-in staff was not particularly friendly, including a bellman who copped an attitude with me when I asked a simple question about the check-in process. There were only three check-in agents at what must’ve been at least five or six stations, for a line of 15 to 20 guests. We were also promised an email once our room was ready, as we arrived earlier than the designated check-in time, that we never received. I completely understand that check-in times are there for reason, however if you’re not actually going to email us when the room is ready don’t promise that email. The elevators are a complete disaster. It took at least 10 minutes to get an elevator going up to the floor our room was on, and even then, they’re so tiny and cramped an extremely small number of guests can fit in the elevator. So we were forced to wait two more rounds in order to even get on one that went upstairs, bringing our total wait time to over 15 minutes. We experience the same drama with elevators upon check out, it took over 15 minutes for an elevator to even show up to our floor, and again we had to wait two more rounds of elevators coming and going before we could get on one that wasn’t full and actually took us downstairs. The bathroom in our room was a complete joke. It’s so cramped and tiny, with absolutely zero counter space. It was barely even useful. The hairdryer that was provided also did not function properly, it blew only cold air. The ice machines on at least two floors were broken so we had to deal with more elevator drama just to go somewhere and get some ice. When I called the front desk to inquire about the ice situation, I asked if at any point the ice machines were going to be repaired, and I was just flatly told “no.” What customer service! (Insert sarcasm here) The website advertises collapsible, eco-friendly cups, for use at the refillable water stations throughout the hotel. We were provided cheap plastic cups with lids that were made for use with a straw, but no straws were provided. That sounds silly as I even type it out, I fully recognize something as small as lids and no straws shouldn’t make a huge impact on my vacation, and technically it didn’t. But the problem I really have is what was advertised and promised was not delivered. Bottom line, I do NOT recommend this property and will not be returning ",1/23/18,1
"The worse problem is the staff. TERRIBLE. The worse I've met in the entire World.In 3rd world countries the staff was always nicer and kind. Staff is RUDE! NOT professional, and they treat the costumers like numbers.Its an OLD Hotel, floor is old carpet, terrible to clean and if there is a fire, i doubt anyone will survive, the hotel itself is a death trap. Terrible noise insulation, if any! Doors shutting all the time, you can ear ,EVERYTHING, whats going on in other rooms.No breakfast and cleaning leave a lot to desire.No laundry pick up in the room or drop off.5th or 6th stay in this hotel, should have complained long agoNO environmental concern at all. if i cold chose my hotel id rather stay in Long islan ",1/23/18,1
"Paid $150 before getting there on Booking.com. Then when I got there I had to pay another $160ish. The lady behind the desk didn't tell me she was charging this, which I was thought sly. ($100 of this is apparently being refunded, but we'll see). Then at check-out I was charged another $68.24. Nice stay but watch out for their BS hidden fees.I'd advise seeking out reviews of other places before booking here. Location was extremely ideal (1-2 min walk from Times Sq) and wifi was excellent. Just those fees that ruined my stay (and my bank account, as a student) ",1/22/18,3
"The hotel is really well located and close to many key places. The room we stayed was really small, but it was always clean and well maintained. The service was fair, but we liked a lot the band that played alive on Thursday. Our stay was fine ",1/22/18,4
This was my second time staying at this hotel and yet again not disappointed . The check in was quick and the staff on the desk were fantastic and very welcoming . The rooms in the hotel are quite small but are well maintained during my stay. There is a free safety deposit box in the room so no need to worry about your valuables . The hotel location is on 8th av just round the corner from Times Square and Broadway so fantastic location . I would highly recommend this hotel and I will be back again. Thank you Row NYC for being part of another great visit to New York .,1/22/18,5
"What seems like a bargain in the heart of Times Square really isn't. By the time taxes and ""facilities"" fees are added on you wonder if you get what you pay for? We ""won the lottery"" for an ""upgrade"" to an allegedly larger room which was far less than spacious. It just provided what is at best a normal sized room with few if any amenities. There was no means to cool or heat beverages. No mini fridge or microwave or even the ubiquitous electric coffee maker. Beds were fine and free wi fi. Bathroom was adequate. Several staff members we encountered, front desk and security, were rude with hostile attitudes. After five such days someone actually smiled and interacted pleasantly. I almost fainted with shock. But step out the door and there we were in the heart of Times Square. In the dead of winter it was great to have a short walk back to the hotel after an evening of theatre. We will return in winter but knowing that you get what you pay for or perhaps less. Their City Kitchen offered a range of food items. We opted for the breakfast burritos ",1/22/18,3
"The overall service was professional, accommodating and friendly. Rooms were clean and quite cute! Location was pretty central, you could walk to quite a bit. Overall we loved it and would stay again, but the extra hidden $100 amenities charge is a bit crazy... Most of the hotels do it, bundle all their extra amenities and charge you for it at the end, like internet, water station.. ",1/22/18,5
"We are so happy to have discovered this hotel. It was within walking distance to everything we needed (theater, restaurants, train station) on our weekend trip to see a show. The decor of the hotel is great, the staff was friendly and accommodating and the room was clean and comfortable ",1/22/18,5
"Location was great, hotel is in times square attached to a delicious “food court deli” with multiple options, however our rooms were disappointing it was very small and beds were not quality def not like the pictures. Our ac/ heating system was not working it would get extremely hot and all of a sudden shoot out very cold ac as a result i woke up with a sore throat. ",1/22/18,3
"Great hotel! we stayed 7 days in the hotel and you can´t ask for a better location to stay! everything is super near, subway, food, entertanment, shoping, great view, etc i will return to this hotel : ",1/22/18,5
"I arrived at Row last Sunday, a bit worried given the reviews I'd read about long queues for check in, etc. I have to say it exceeded my expectations. We arrived early, around 10.30am. Checked in but our room wasn't ready so left our bags with the concierge. We returned just before 5pm and there was no wait to collect our keys. Our room was on the 8th floor with a nice view which I wasn't expecting. The room itself was basic in decor but we didn't come to NYC to spend any time in the hotel. The bathroom had a bath which was a nice surprise and well needed after being on our feet all day. Breakfast was included in our room, and I agree with previous reviews that this was pretty cheap - one pastry, one hot drink and a piece of fruit. If you wanted water you have to have it from the tap, you're not allowed one of the bottles on the counter. That said the pastries were delicious. The hotel reception is modern, clean and oddly smells beautiful! The facilities fee was a bit of a rob - $34 per night. We were never going to use the gym and I had my own hot water bottle. The location of this hotel is perfect though. A stone's throw from everything you came to NYC to do and see. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends and family. Although some downsides, it was an absolute bargain for the price we paid in such a great location. ",1/22/18,4
Good comfortable room without frills. Free Wifi with reception good throughout the hotel. Fantastic views from our room on the 27th floor. Helpful staff and hotel at a good standard of cleanliness. Great location on 8th Avenue being just 3 mins walk from Times Square. Close to subway with transport easy to and from airports,1/22/18,4
We were not told about room deposit facilities fees WiFi fees we upgraded our room for $40 got a bill for over $170 asked for a wake up call which we never received just a shocking bill already took from my card before we checked out!!! Disgusting end to our otherwise great trip shameful,1/22/18,1
"Clean, reasonably priced hotel in theater district. Great location. Room was small but clean and close to theaters, Penn Station and many bars and restaurants. Check in was quick and they offer luggage storage ",1/22/18,4
"Two years after staying here, this is still a terrible hotel. Their service has not improved even slightly. Still unprofessional upper-management who sits in an office all day long replying to online reviews with the same generic response. Still fully-untrained, unsupervised, staff with hostile attitudes creating their own rules and regulations ",1/21/18,1
"Been to the Row about four or five times and I like that it is a block from all the theatres! Subway is right there. Especially love the fun, city vibe and the City kitchen where an easy and cheap breakfast or lunch awaits with some fabulous 2nd floor window seats and people watching. I’ve had great rooms and ok roooms, some with amazing views and others unremarkable. The hotel can be quite busy at times and it is always filled with people coming and going. The price point is good for the location. It is good enough that I have gone back multiple times with my daughters ",1/21/18,3
"Stayed one night with my son to see Springsteen on Broadway. Location of the hotel is excellent, check-in/check-out was fast and easy. Room size was a little small, but for the price, it was well worth it ",1/21/18,4
"Just arrived home this morning from another perfect stay! This was our second time visiting ROW NYC and again, we could not fault the hotel at all.The Room:The room has central heating/air con, so whatever time of year you visit you'll find the perfect temperature! Our heater kicked in automatically when the room reached a certain temperature, which was really handy as it was so cold outside! The heater was slightly noisy, but you get used to it in no time! It's a very nice touch to receive cups for using at the water machine (located on every floor, but if you want ice then these machines are only located on certain floors - check the wall by the water machine for the signs that state which floor). Every room has a safe for free, which you choose the combination for - this is really handy for keeping your valuables safe! Big enough television in every room, with a wide variety of tv channels - channel number 1 is very handy for tips around the area (particularly if you're going to be using the subway like us!) - the channels also include various children's stations for families. Complimentary soap, shower gel and conditioner etc in the bathrooms. Lots of storage space. Very clean and tidy - the maids visit every day and are all extremely pleasant to speak to and nothing is too much.The Food:We didn't actually try the food in the hotel, but City Kitchen is part of this hotel and it looks and smells amazing - we did get coffee etc. which was reasonably priced. Staff:All staff that we encountered were very helpful and friendly once again, they even gave us a nice room upgrade for free as we were returning customers - this just made our opinion and views on this hotel sky rocket further! So nice to be appreciated. Check in etc. was all handled extremely quickly and hassle free (make sure you have a credit card for your resort fee etc.) although you can pay by cash upon checkout.We had a few tickets that needed printing off for an event we had planned, and a member of staff came and helped us do this on the free internet access located in the lobby. Upon checkout, the gentlemen at the front doors will give you a ticket and take care of your cases if you have a late flight (remember to keep some spare money for a tip for them, they work hard! )Facilities:Hotel has free Wi-Fi for all guests and is very high quality! There is a shop located at the back of the lift ways in the main lobby (they sell drinks, sweets, crisps etc. )Location:Perfect location, it would be extremely difficult to get a better site than this! You get the great feel of Manhattan and Times Square is literally a 2 minute walk around the corner - just turn left or right on the street and you'll see it! It's perfect for all broadway shows! Plenty of subway stations close by, or if this isn't your thing... Getting a taxi/cab is very easy! Other useful info:- Check out time is 12pm- When using the lifts, type in the number of your floor on the keypad and it will tell you which lift to go into- Credit card needed to check in (although you can opt to pay fees in cash on check out)- If you need the toilet in the lobby, make sure you have your room card key! You need this to access the toilets.- The hotel has a great concierge.- Half an hour free internet usage on the computers in the lobby.- Very short walk to Central Park- There's a telephone in your room- There's an ironing board and iron in your room- Maid service is daily (be sure to use the do not disturb sign if you do not need your room cleaned)I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to every single person, no matter what you're into or what you're looking for, this hotel will cater for you! Some great views from the rooms also (check out the photos ",1/21/18,5
"I waited some time before writing this review. I traveled to NY for a conference in April. My employer was paying for the rooms and he told me everything was set. I arrived a day before him and he told me you are all set the hotel is aware you are coming. I got to the hotel and they told me they needed a card on file and that they needed to put a hold on my card for the first night. I said that would be okay. When I got to my room it was dirty and old. Curtains had stains the vents were disgusting and my bed had stains. I was appalled as his hotel was highly rated. I did not want to complain because my employer was paying. I then checked my bank account and the hotel took out money for all the days we would be staying, over $600. I called the front desk and they said nothing could be done and that the money could not be put back on my account. I was on the phone forever with no one who could help me. So basically I was lied to. I was told only a hold for the first night would be put on my card when that was in fact not the case. It took 5 days for my money to be put back in my account. I wrote a review to the hotel and they never contacted me at all regarding their mistake and also the disgusting room I had to stay in. I would recommend no one stay in this hotel as I will never go back. I took pictures of the hotel room, so if I ever am contacted I have evidence of the filthy conditions. Do not be deceived the lobby looks phenomenal, the rooms do not ",1/21/18,1
"The Row hotel has a cool vibe, friendly staff and comfy beds. Great fun place to stay for business or with friends. Rooms are small but clean and comfortable. Breakfast can be quick and sumple or go to the attached City Kitchen food court for a yummy omelette to start your day ",1/20/18,5
"We booked this hotel through a travel agent as a package holiday! Our room was a standard and after reading some reviews I was getting nervous at staying here but honestly I was pleasantly surprised!! I couldn’t ask for a better room, we stayed on the 14th floor which was fantastic for the view. The room was clean and tidy and a lot bigger then I expected! Couple of downsides were that the heater was loud when it was on but heated up the room very quickly, also the shower took about 5 mins to heat up..! All in all it was a good hotel and me and my partner were happy we stayed here. Pictures below were our view from our windows ",1/20/18,4
The Location can’t be better for this pride of hotel. I just wished there could have been in room hot water so we can have a hot drink in early morning and late at night after a person has changed out into PJ,1/20/18,3
After a long day of travel CESAR made check-in SOOO PLEASANT! Love the location and City Kitchen! Our go to hotel in NYC! So convenient for the theater district and close to good Hell's Kitchen food - The elevators are awesome,1/19/18,5
"Friendly staff, easy check in and check out. Location was perfect for all our outings. Being steps from Times Square, the subway station and the bus terminal made access simple. Clean rooms and comfortable beds made our stay enjoyable. ",1/19/18,4
"Fantastic location less than 2 minute walk to time square. I would say this hotel is a mid to upscale property with a very modern feel. Staff were friendly and security was good. The room was a good size for a city location not massive but certainly not tiny. Comfortable and clean a great place to get your head down after a busy day exploring, however if your not informed beforehand be careful of the $30 a night resort fee. ",1/19/18,4
"Checked in no problem, rooms small but that typical of lots of hotels in NYC, beds soooo comfortable, shower was maybe not as forceful as I would have liked but it did me ok. Rooms very warm however others complained of theirs being cold. We were able to adjust the heat as necessary. Beds changes every day and bins emptied too. Iron, ironing board, hair dryer all in room, safe too. Only major fault was that there was no coffee/ tea making facility in the room, that would have been nice. We were on 22nd floor which was quiet, you do have to be mindful of other guests as we heard others coming in late and laughing etc, bit inconsiderate of them however too tired to get out of bed. We didnt eat in the hotel but had breakfast which was included in our package, it consisted of tea/coffee, banana, orange, cold egg but if you took an egg you couldnt take the fruit, there was also a selection of scones, pastry etc...The bar staff were amazing, 3 in particular, Brendan, Kelly and the other name slips my mind, they gav us lots of tips n ideas and were very friendly and helpful. The hotel location was great, few mins walk from Times Square, lots of eating places nearby, theatres, Port Authority a few minutes away, great for bus to New Jersey Gardens (25mins)for shopping and subway which I didnt use. There was an itemised bill through our door the night before we were to checkout for $145 which was a standard bill everyone got, well we had bottles of water on ours for $2.30 x2 which was paid for at breakfast time. On our package we knew we had to pay $108 so im not sure where the other amounts came from, we argued our case as we had our amount in writing. The checkout guy was actually very rude so be careful of whatever charges are mandatory. They do take ur credit card details incase of damage or breakages and to pay for the extra charges which we wanted to pay cash, that seemed to annoy the checkin guy too. All in all I had a great time, ive never been to NYC before so ive nothing to compare hotels etc but all I needed was a comfortable bed as I was out early n back lat ",1/19/18,4
Location is AWESOME. Staff service is Excellent. I've always had a great service experience with The Row. Staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful in finding various things throughout the city. I love the alcove where you can pick up a wide variety of food,1/19/18,4
The Row NYC hotel is a wonderful modern hotel with generously sized rooms and great service. It's close to the crosstown subway and is in the heart of Hell's Kitchen. I enjoy the convenience of the elevator system and the ability to store my luggage once I check out,1/19/18,4
Hotel was generaly grubby and not maintained very well. Dirty paintwork and carpets unclean. No storage for clothes. No tea and coffee making facility in room and no cafe in hotel. Staff were surley and unhelpful not the usual US welcome and smiles.,1/19/18,2
"Hotel room is not so clean, there is a lot of dirty in the aisle and in the rooms (mainly a carpet dusty)They charge USD 9.00 to handling packages delivered at hotel. I purchased some products in Amazon that came from other cities and the freight was USD 7.00. To bring the packages from the ground floor to 26th floor the hotel charged USD 9.00. To let the things worst, it´s not possible to collect your packages at the front desk. In other words, it´s a trap. Much better request to collect your packages at Port Authority station, 2 blocks down at 8thAve in an Amazon pick-up point ",1/19/18,2
"From the warm, friendly reception I received at the check-in desk from Christina S, to the helpful assistance I encountered checking in my bags upon early arrival, it was clear that the staff was very attentive to customer needs. My 26th floor corner room was surprisingly spacious, with a partial view of Times Square and lovely surrounding architecture. Great stay! I can't wait to return ",1/18/18,5
"We arrived at this amazing hotel and was told upon check-in by a very friendly lady that we had been upgraded to the penthouse suite free of charge by her manager! Can't thank the Row NYC enough for this! The room was absolutely spectacular very very comfortable bed (Fell asleep within minutes of laying down!) Wifi very fast! Loved the idea that you turn your room key into a souvineer! The shower felt like you were actually in a rain shower outside! The Row NYC has a perfect location, just minutes from Times Square! The nearest subway was Port Authority which was 2 minutes away. When I return to NYC I will definitely be staying here! This has definitely been the best hotel I've ever stayed in ",1/18/18,5
"I should've known when I came to check-in at 8pm and was told the room wasn't ready and saw people trying to change rooms with other front desk staff that this wasn't going to be good... I was told to wait 1/2 hour at the bar and the receptionist would come and get me. I waited 1 hour and was told he had gone home when I returned to the counter. Room was tiny, smelt heavily of cleaning fluid. Bathroom outdated and was insanely small. lots of small flies throughout my stay (I see others complained of this too). No mini-fridge, no water. The heating came on every 30-40 mins and sounded like people banging on pipes, as soon as it was warm the A/C kicked in to cool it... the cycle went on all night since the thermostat didn't work. The showers are great if you have 1/2 hour to rinse off since the water pressure is less than most rain storms. When I asked to be moved I was told there were NO other rooms available, kinda hard to believe in a place this big, and that maintenance would be along shortly - they never showed up. Staff at front desk - useless and/or rude. Bar/breakfast staff were great.Oh and the FREE WiFi - see the small print for the daily $30+ additional fee - this is apparently for it and the plastic 'reusable water containers' [i.e. plastic cups], in your room - pathetic rip-off ",1/18/18,1
"massively disappointed , booked as a surprise for new year & the pictures on the web site didn't match the rooms . The rooms were Dirty & our lock was broken also the towels were yellow & had someone else's hair on it . we went to reception who moved us to another room which was the same but 2 double beds even then we used our own towels & unfortunately we tried other hotels but they were booked due to season . on the last day we asked to keep the room on & were asked for another £60 for 3 hours which we declined . the whole thing cause stress & arguments between our party & not 1 offer of reasonable compensation was offered . maybe painting the rooms ,updating the furniture & vacuuming them would help , also updating the pictures to show the true rooms not a edited or photo shopped ones . massively un happy & please do not add a generic apolog ",1/18/18,1
"This has been my second time at this hotel. I was lucky to find a very good deal for a deluxe room with a view. The only two complaints would be that there was no water dispenser on my floor, and that the hotel did not offer a free EU adapter to the US. But in the first case there was only one floor to go up, and in the second, there were two USB ports with which we could charge mobile phones ",1/18/18,5
Brown water came out of our sink and shower during our stay between January 11-15th 2018. Room walls were very thin too and could hear conversations next to us. Good location but would consider staying at another hotel next time,1/18/18,3
"A large-capacity, modern hotel in the heart of New York's theater district, Row NYC offers everything a visitor would ask for in terms of comfort and accessibility at a price that won't break the bank ",1/17/18,5
"The elevator arrangement is very good, I had never experienced something like that before. The ROW is a great place, but beware if you're overweight: you won't be able to enter the bathroom. The rooms are sound proof, which is nice and pretty unique in New York. Checking out was a breeze, but I didn't know you could see that for yourself on the back page of the final statement ",1/17/18,4
"Had stayed here a few times many years ago when it was The Milford and thought with the renovations it would be even better, but not the case. The location is great, the staff were friendly, and the room was clean, but there were some issues as well. - The bathroom door is a sliding barn style door which made using the bathroom very awkward for my friends and I as there is no actual closed door preventing everyone else from hearing everything going on in there. The toilet and shower also both squeaked. Not even getting started on the bathroom size...not even enough room for feet comfortably between the toilet and garbage can against the wall. - The heater made noise throughout the night, not just a turning on and off sound, but a gurgling banging, weird noise that led us to decide the heater was in need of an exorcism, it was bad.- No fridge or microwave, yes looking now it doesn't list those for the room, but haven't seen a hotel in recent years that doesn't have those so we were surprised to not have a fridge to put some of the snacks and beverages we had brought in....- The self check in and out tablets are great in theory, but it would help if they worked. We arrived to a HUGE line up at the front desk to check in and decided to try it, none of the options could pull up the reservation. The group in front of us tried it as well and they had no luck, then someone ahead said everyone they had seen go to use it returned to the line because it wasn't working for anyone ",1/17/18,3
"Location is the major highlight of this property. Traveling alone, I wanted a hotel were I could leave and arrive by myself at night in safety. So, being right behind Times Square was a right choice. I had issues in my room and staff was able to rearrange it the following day. Even if it wasn’t as prompt as I would like, I appreciated their attention and support. Rooms are really small and may be smelly. ",1/17/18,3
"My teenage daughter and I have been coming here for 3 years. This year was an unbelievable experience and stay at ROW NYC, the staff was more than helpful and friendly, our room had the most unbelievable views. I cannot say enough about how great this trip was this year, thank you ",1/17/18,5
"Went to New York with three friends and we booked the ROW. Good location, but the service at check in was poor, after a 7 hour flight, the last thing you wanted to do was queue for at least 30 mins because they didn’t have enough staff on (2) for at least 30 people checking in. We had a what they called a superior room, but there wasn’t a lot of room for 4 people to share. Never ate in the restaurant so can’t review this ",1/17/18,3
The rooms at the Row are very small but the beds are comfortable and bathrooms are modern and nice. The food court off the lobby is a gem. Lots of great options of high quality food. I was traveling with a high school group so the food court was perfect as we had little time or money and kids with a variety of food preferences. The Row is in a great location if you want to be near Broadway shows.,1/17/18,4
"We were able to check in early with no problems. For being in the city, the room was fairly quiet. This hotel is centrally located just a block from times square and close to a major subway station (Port Authority). I will stay here again ",1/17/18,4
This hotel was the perfect place to stay for a fun-filled theatre weekend. It’s right in the heart of the theatres and restaurants - literally only steps away. The rooms were spacious and clean  the staff friendly and helpful. We will definitely stay there again,1/16/18,5
"We've stayed here a lot, and never had a perfect stay, but have consistently had a great stay. It's very busy, and there are bumps along the way for check-in or room functionality, but they are quick to resolve problems and always friendly ",1/16/18,4
"This hotel is located in the HEART of the theater district. The staff are very helpful. The lobby was full all weekend all It has a very energetic vibe. If you are looking for a great location and great value, this is it ",1/16/18,5
"Yes the rooms are compact but what more do you need if you’re out all day, fresh towels each day, friendly staff & a superb location. For what you pay it’s great value for money!! Also a big up to the gym, good quality equipment! ",1/16/18,4
"The hotel is prime location for anyone who is interested in staying in New York and time square, just a note font try and check in early its new York and there very busy plan to come in around check in time. The hotel is stunning so are the rooms and fitness center ",1/16/18,5
"We were recommended this hotel by our travel agent and colleagues that had stayed here previously. Unfortunately we did not enjoy our stay at the Row NYC, from being moved rooms due to insects in our bathroom to our air conditioning unit sounding like a jet engine about to take off in our room, sorry but I would not stay here again or recommend this hotel. Several aircon engineers who worked for the hotel came up to our room to fix the aircon, but it still was extremely noisy and disturbing all night long! The walls are so paper thin, we heard the couple give the performance of their lives through the night and again at 5am, we don’t have kids but I imagine this to be a very awkward conversation if they were asleep next door! I think for the price, I would definitely pay more next time I’m in NYC for a higher standard hotel and guarantee ourselves a good night sleep with no noisy aircon or neighbours.. ",1/15/18,2
"Great experience! Location makes it easily accessible to the theaters, Times Square, and excellent restaurants. Would definitely stay here again! Room was very clean! Employees, for the most part were very friendly and helpful ",1/15/18,5
I stayed here for four nights and really enjoyed my stay. The room was very clean and tidy and cleaned daily. All the other staff were very friendly and helpful with any queries i had. It was also in a superb location being just a short walk from broadway and times square. Considering it was in such a central location it was very quiet. All in all it was a very enjoyable stay which i would recommend to anyone,1/15/18,5
"The rooms are ok, but the staff are unprofessional hard to get of them, especially if you are coming from different country and you need help to get around. Lack of hospitality and professionalism and The absence of carring. It took me 2 hours to get of hold of front desk and they answered you fell the welcome cold in their voices ",1/15/18,1
"My stay here great, the room was spotless, the bathroom was spotless. The restaurants within are great and I would definitely stay gere again. The location was perfect, minutes away from any place you would have wanted to visi ",1/15/18,5
"The location is perfect, the hotel is upscale, the valet parking is super easy and convenient. The price overall is reasonable.The rooms are clean and comfy and fairly quiet (for a city that never sleeps). It's my go-to hotel for NYC adventures - it's a splurge but any trip to NYC is a splurge IMO. Well worth it ",1/15/18,5
"Just returned from a 4 night stay, Checkin was fast and efficient staff pleasant. Rooms are very small but they do the job free safe in room. Location is brilliant minutes from Times Square, subways, theatres and loads of eating places,Price was good for this hotel, be aware you are charged $50 per night per room deposit( refundable on checkout)Also charged $32.47 per room per night resort fee for use of Internet, gym and iMac suite you pay this regardless if you use any of the above and its non refundable.Oh and the hotel stinks of weed. Would defiantly stay here again ",1/14/18,5
"Perfect location for attending Broadway shows and Times Square. Very reasonable winter rates. Quiet, clean and comfortable. Room was small, but ok for the rate. Elevator call system makes getting to room from lobby fast. ",1/14/18,5
Great price but then they add $32 facility fee. I only use wireless. That’s more than I pay on a month for wireless. This fee is like having your pocket picked. My room was $102 then they added facility fee of $32,1/14/18,3
"The only thing that was annoying was the air conditioning. We went when it was cold out and the heater only worked when it wanted to. Also, our last day there we felt rushed out of our room by the cleaning staff. They kept asking us when we were leaving and we still had an hour to check out. So that was annoying. Other than that everything was perfect and I loved it. New York is such a busy place ",1/14/18,5
"We were a little apprehensive prior to our 5 night visit regarding some of the reviews on here. We needn’t have been. We enjoyed our stay here. On arrival at the hotel on 30th December we were greeted by a very pleasant man on the check in desk. He told us that somehow our room with a view that had been booked for many months was not available and he would knock the amenities charge off of our stay as way of compensation. I expressed my disappointment at this after traveling 22 hours to get there, stating that I’d rather pay the fees and have a view so he went off to seek his management. Upon his return he swiftly checked us into a room with the perfect view for us. Our room on the 18th floor over looking 44th street and 8th Avenue although small and compact was spotless clean with comfortable beds. Our room was cleaned daily to a high standard and the towels were plentiful and replaced daily. The internet was fast and worked well during our stay and there did not appear to be a limit to the usage of devices we could use in the room meaning we could connect our iPads as well as our phones. All staff members that we encountered were extremely friendly and approachable. I feel that I must give special mention to the maids on the day of the snow storm (Thursday 4th January) They showed great empathy and concern for us leaving for the airport that day. They were so lovely to us. Our flight ended up being cancelled and although we were disappointed we could not extend our stay at the hotel because they had no rooms available we were able to use the phone at the concierge desk to call the airline to rearrange flights and another hotel to accommodate the 4 extra nights we were stranded for. The lady who checked us out pointed us in the direction of where to purchase emergency supplies that we now needed to tide us over until we could get home and gave us a usb adaptor so that we could charge our phones in the next hotel as we had rather stupidly binned our uk travel plugs when we had packed our cases thinking we were going home. The hotel is in a brilliant area for exploring with its close proximity to the main tourist areas and attractions. Attached to the hotel is the City kitchen that serves a lovely selection of food as well as the Sugar Factory which served our sweet tooth after a tiring day exploring the city. We would absolutely not hesitate to return to this hotel, our stay at the Edison hotel until we could fly home just didn’t match up to the friendliness and cleanliness of the Row. ",1/14/18,5
we stayed here for 4 nights and was a great place to be based when exploring new york. right next to times square and subway stations so easy to get arround. room was a good size considering it is in the eart of new york. our flight was delayed by a night and they were very acomidating with this. a very modern place to stay,1/14/18,5
"I normally stay at Row NYC when I visit NYC. I love this it’s centrally located and it’s a great price value for that area. But this time I stayed was different. The staff was nice and friendly as always. When I opened the door the room smelled like mildew and I noticed that the pillow cases were dirty. Also, the TV was not working properly and as the temperature dropped the room got colder and colder I turned heat and no heat came on. I went as high as 80 degrees, yet nothing. I only stayed one and as I was leaving the heat finally came on....go figure. This was a disappointing stay : ",1/14/18,3
"We stayed here for 4 nights January 2018. Hotel is fab location and we had a peek of the screens from Times Square from our bedroom window. Beds are so comfortable. Room was clean and was acceptable. I’m quite picky so would have preferred it to be immaculate, having said that , I should have paid a lot more for 5*. Heating system is so loud. It came on automatically every hour on the hour. The noise of it woke us up. First night I called reception and an engineer was sent and turned it off. We finally got some sleep. The second night it did the exactly the same again. I called reception and another engineer was sent. This time we asked for the entire heating system to be shut down in our room. It was. After this it was fine and no noise. The hotel itself is very hot and the heat was felt instantly when we came out of the lift. It was nice to arrive to our cool room. Lifts we read a lot of negatives on. We didn’t find them a problem. However our room was located away from the lifts however I can imagine the noise of them should you be close by as this could be heard when waiting for them. Reception and lobby area nice. Wish there wasn’t the sales guys for the hotel chain trying to get us to go see their hotels in return for a gift. I’m in New York, I want to do my own thing not view new hotels. I wouldn’t stay here again personally but our stay was pleasant. ",1/13/18,3
"We stayed at the hotel and had 2 rooms 12/30-1/2. The hotel is a perfect location to 5th Avenue (walking distance 15 minutes) Broadway, 1/2 block from Times Square and many more. If you are not familiar with NYC I would also recommend Giovanni with tours by locals! He was the best for our family of 5 with 3 teenagers. He took us all around the city and we were able to view everything. Great hotel, great location and great family vacation! ",1/13/18,4
"This hotel is centrally located in the theater district. Our room was quite small. The view was great! When we checked in, it was after midnight and we were using the kiosk to check in. We were having a little problem and a staff member came to help us. She was very helpfull! ",1/13/18,4
"The sad thing about the wake up call is that doesnt feel like a wake up call, its not for a person that half awake that could choose the wrong option, but its great that the front office was ready at 5 o'clock in the morning for check ou ",1/13/18,4
"Stayed here in May 2017 for 10 nights with my other half.The main point for this hotel is the location, about a 10 minute walk to times square and surrounded by lots of attractions, restaurants and a tube stop at the end of the block. Rooms were very clean, and the A.C. was helpful. Good facilities and very handy having a shop on site. Few options in the small food outlets on site too which was great. Cannot fault the hotel for the money, not luxury but your not paying insane prices for where you are located. Would definitely use again! ",1/13/18,4
"Paid for top floor room which we didn’t get on night 1 and no compensation! When moved, we had a blocked toilet and no paper for 3 days & a blocked sink for 2 days! Rooms very small - photos are very deceptive!! ",1/13/18,1
The location was perfect. Close to Times Square and Broadway Theathers.I got an upgrade and rewards for check in through the hotel. Also they give you advise for a better stay if you want and help you to get tickets and dinner reservations if you needed. Great beds and clean. I did not have any problem at al,1/13/18,5
Please read previous page. The beasties/insects that were flying out the shower drain bit us on our legs when showering. We ended up with sores on our lower legs due to this. We were on holiday to get married on 5th January at the city clerks office. My wife couldn’t wear her expensive wedding dress due to the bites on her legs. She had to wear trousers instead. I couldn’t wear my kilt as the wool socks irritated the bites on my legs. This whole incident ruined our wedding and was totally unacceptable. We were given another room when I complained about the beasties/insects. However the damage had already been done. Thanks to the hotel the day that was meant to be the best off our lives was totally ruined due to the bathroom cleanliness.,1/12/18,1
Had a great experience here on my trip to NYC. The room was clean and the staff were plentiful and knowledgeable to questions I had about the city and getting around. The bar down stairs is perfect for a quick drink or bite before you embark into Times Square. Location couldn't be better. Highly recommended,1/12/18,5
"Perfect location. Hotel was clean and staff friendly. A busy travelers hotel that offers all you need. Bar and food court fabulous. Very relaxed. Easy check in and out without any problems. Free calls from your room overseas was a huge surprise and welcomed. Places to eat over the road perfect, 24/7, safe area. Loved it and most definitely return to this hotel ",1/12/18,5
We stayed in a wheelchair accessible room the room was really spacious the bathroom even more so it made my daughters stay so comfortable one of the best accessible rooms stayed in so far. The breakfast was ok for adults but not great for children nice clean friendly hotel missed having tea/ coffee facilities in the room,1/11/18,5
"Times Square in NYC is expensive. They suck you for every dollar they can get out of you. The same goes for hotels. ROW NYC was located perfectly however it is big and the turn over in people was immense. There seemed to be far too many young people, many from the UK. It was loud and too busy. The rooms were small but OK. We upgraded for a few dollars more. Better view and space. Worth the money. Other than that it is just an average hotel with nothing spectacular to see. ",1/11/18,3
"This hotel is all about location. It’s near to subway stations, restaurants, Junior’s cheesecake and Broadway shows. The rooms are very confort and spacious! The breakfast is complete, however it lacks scrambled eggs. This is our second time and in NYC and will repeat. ",1/11/18,4
The hotel location as great however.... the room heater was extremely noisy . The hotel charges you 30dollars a day to use the gym. It’s basic bang for buck. The additional fee’s increase the room rate really quickly,1/10/18,3
After reading some awful reviews on trip advisor I was very worried about our stay in this hotel. I really had nothing to worry about. From start to finish our experience was fantastic. We had only booked a standard room so weren’t expecting much but as soon as we walked into our room and saw the view we were delighted. We were in 2308 the room was basic but very clean and had everything we needed. All staff we met were friendly and helpful. We never had to wait more than a few minutes for a lift even when it was busy. The location is excellent and we will definitely use this hotel when we visit again. Thank you to all at the row,1/10/18,5
"Location is nice, the hotel staff seriously ruined tge trip for us, they made an effort to make everything difficult from the start. although the hotel wasn't fully booked, but they kept claiming otherwise. Room rates are negotiaable strangely enough. ",1/9/18,2
District M served guests who ordered alcoholic drinks more readily than the guests ordered coffee. You ordered and waiting for your coffee but no one hurried busy with serving expensive drinks.It is a shame,1/9/18,3
Overall we had a nice stay at this hotel. the room was small but i expected that. We were also on the street side and it was very noisy at night. The check in process was very easy and our room was ready 4 hours early so that was great. It is super convenient to the theater and attractions we wanted to see.so that was worth staying her. If I was going to stay longer than a night I would look for somewhere else to stay. It was just really small and too noisy,1/9/18,3
"Location, perfect. Rooms - cold and heater very intermittent. Duvets not thick enough for time of year and outside temperature. Hotel generally tired and in need of a lick of paint. However, for the price I guess it was acceptable ",1/9/18,3
"Were not at all accommodating when I was stuck in a snow storm and had no way to get to their hotel. They charged me the whole price, couldn't even give me a partial refund. I will not be looking to book at this hotel in the future ",1/9/18,1
"Stayed with friends to celebrate a 40th birthday. Room was very small as most are in NYC, have stayed in bigger rooms and this one was an upgrade, I’m guessing the upgrade was for view not size. Hotel is very central and right in the mix but this does mean it’s noisy all day and night. 8th Avenue must be the noisiest street in the city. No kettle in the rooms but there is hot water available from a machine on every other floor if your desperate for a cuppa. All in all a pleasant stay ",1/8/18,3
"Good service, staff, cleanliness, and excellent trip. Love New York city, it was like a dream. Love food and people it's so nice with the tourist, very recommended the hotel row. Great place and excellent locatio ",1/8/18,5
"This was our fourth time staying here in the last year . Chosen solely on affordable price and location. The big food court is a plus on cold days . Overall pretty nice place but the rooms are small. My only complaint is that they only give you three ( very flat ) pillows . Why 3? Shouldn’t each person get two ? And every morning I could hear the maids loudly talking and laughing outside my room while they were cleaning other rooms . This was frustrating, as I was exhausted from all of the walking and frigid temps on this trip. The $65 early check in fee was worth it since it was freezing out. Would stay her again but maybe bring my own pillow and ask for a loud fan ?! ",1/8/18,3
This is a cool modern hotel with an amazing location. I was able to see two Broadway theaters from my rooms window. The staff are kind and most of the checking / checkout services can be done online. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable.,1/8/18,5
"The location is spot on, which is why it’s a busy hotel. 2 minute walk to time square, 20 minute walk to Central Park and Rockefeller Centre. 25/30 minute walk to Empire State Building (approx times depending on how fast/slow you walk)Our room 1826 was basic. Can’t really complain, kinda small I guess. The view was non existing we legit looked onto another room! But at the end of the day your not there to look out a window or stay in your room all day. I found that when you tipped the room cleaners they cleaned your room better and left little extras. We stayed 1 week but only tipped like 2/3 times. Our plug in the bathroom stopped working also and we didn’t have warm water one day. Front desk .. not much to say. We were greeted with a women who didn’t even smile or say anything - not even “Hi welcome to Row” bla bla bla. I asked for an upgrade and she said “umm.. no” she didn’t tell us anything at all like we didn’t know you could get free water etc, you get an ice bucket and two plastic cups but we didn’t know what it was for as we couldn’t see any ice machines on our floor and didn’t want to ask because over hearing how rude the front desk were to other residents. Whoever owns Row needs to witness their employees and do some serious training! Some tips ..Time square for eating is a little expensive, try eating around Hells Kitchen and 100% go to china town for food as that was our cheapest dinner we had staying and was so yummy ",1/8/18,3
"The location was perfect, but the first room was not clean (dirty bathroom, dirty carpet, dirty furniture vanity)The second room was clean but the shower had no pressure, and it was a room for disabled people.Not a very good experience of this hotel, and the impression that people do not force themselves to hel ",1/8/18,2
"Positive: Good location, reasonable price, friendly staff, many restaurants & bars around, clean room, comfortable bedNegative: Noisy heating systemOverall good experience. I will come back. Thank you ",1/8/18,4
"We were 3 adults traveling for NYE, the room was tiny, we barely had space and the amenities in the room very poor, not even a shower cap. The concierge, a guy, was not concerned at all to help us or provide information on the city or the events of the hotel. The event for NYE was a tourist trap, we were charged $160 per person, 60$ as a fee of the event and the rest to eat or drink. We couldn't even eat or drink to spend those $100...the service was awful and once we got attention of the waiterss she told us the kitchen was closed, and then the same with the bar..... terrible awful experience. Never going back to that hotel and not even close to recommending it ",1/7/18,2
It was really convenient for us to use this hotel because of its prominent location that was so close to Times Square and Central Park and other major landmarks. It was a good pitt stop for us to warm up and drop our bags off before running out again in the cold. Lol,1/7/18,5
"We booked a superior room. I still don’t know what differentiated it from a regular one, but I assume the views are part of it, and they were really great. The room was warm, comfortable and clean, and the hotel feels very well organized and equipped. The food court has different, interesting and affordable dining options. ",1/7/18,5
for the price and the location it is a good deal. 2 blocks away from times square and walking distance from most attraction. There is a subway right around the corner. the room is okay not more and the staff is nice.,1/7/18,3
"Great choice this is our second stay here. We will definitely come back again,and highly recommend this hotel In the heart of Times Square.you can wall to Rockefeller Center and all the Broadway Theatres. ",1/7/18,5
"Very disappointing hotel! The website pictures are 20 years old, that was confirmed by the reception Manager!!! The upgraded rooms were very small, dirty and needing renovation. Needless to say we checked out after 1 night to find a much better hotel for the same money ",1/7/18,1

"Do not stay here.. the only kind of good thing was its location. We were only down the road from Times Square. Everything else was appalling. The staff were so unhelpful and rude, housekeeping wasn't done.. we had to call reception to have fresh towels and bedsheets nearly everyday apart from one day when they just let themselves in my room and I was getting dressed, they didn't even knock or make themselves aware, I thought it was my partner coming back in. We ordered 2 separate rooms for our party of 5 and we were put 9 floors apart which meant we had to go downstairs to the lobby (L1) just to go back up to their floor... I could go on forever, it was awful and I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone ",1/6/18,1
Confirmed a full/queen bed but a 2nd confirmation email said I confirmed a twin. Put a note saying I only needed one bed and upgraded to premium for inconvenience. Got to hotel and did not get premiu,1/6/18,3
Such a great hotel. Such a great location. Although so many peopld are there the rooms are very quiet nice and clean. very re ccomended place to stay. The restaurant is a bit expensive. If you arrive from port authority or the airport it is very close.it is a friendly hotel to everyon,1/6/18,5
"I called ahead for express check in, they said i had to go to the front counter to check in. i went there, and did not get the queen bed i asked for. They advised that when they have a room available for the bed i wanted, they said they'll call as soon as they have the bed is ready. I never got the call. When inside the room, i had called downstairs to ask for more towels, they took approximately 1.5 hours to bring the towels up. Inside the room it was very hard to sleep at night due to the heater which was very loud and would turn on every 5 minutes. I was very disappointed in staff and service as they lied and never called me back with the room i requested. ",1/6/18,2
"Visited in a couple for a surprise birthday trip Dec 19th - 23rd 2017. Book if you’re looking for:1. Great location: central to absolutely everything and suited us down to the ground, only had to jump on the subway for Ground Zero and Brooklyn and the subway station is maybe a 3-5 minute walk from the door.2. Great concierges: really helpful, friendly and efficient.3. Great housekeeping: rooms were spotless every day with clean towels and sheets every day without fail, paid attention to do not disturb signs and never failed to say good morning/afternoon whenever your paths crossed.4. Painless check out experience: so easy. Drop your room key and off you go (only if you’ve already given them credit card details). We had a late night flight so had to leave our luggage in hold - absolutely fine, came back to collect it asked how do we sort an airport taxi transfer - no problem, doorman walked our bags out to a taxi right away and off we went. Don’t book if the below are important to you:1. Front desk customer service: always slow moving, long queues only ever one person on the desk during our peak time stay (we used concierge for everything we couldn’t find on google). Our check in experience wasn’t great, we arrived around lunch time and told no rooms available and that we had to wait for an email notifying us our room was ready. Being from overseas we had to rely on the hotel wifi in order to receive the email so felt like we couldn’t leave. After an hour we asked if there was a luggage hold so we could grab lunch. We were served by a different person who, after 5 minutes of silence (awkward), he assigned us a room! I’m grateful he was able to do that for us, just awkward service. I feel like the first lady who served us could have done the same but it felt like she didn’t bother trying to check. 2. You hate scams: you’ll be approached by someone offering ‘welcome check in gifts’ it’s a timeshare time waster trap with their sister Wyndham hotel.3. Room size: The room was the tiny with a terrible view (pic attached but not really a problem for us as we just used it as a place to wash and crash) and the window opens up about 5 cm.4. Good bathrooms: tiny and shower barely ran and didn’t warm up wellOverall, we would absolutely return to The Row, I can’t believe how ideal the location was and the cleanliness and efficiency of the housekeeping outweighed any front desk opportunities for improvement ",1/6/18,4
"Didn’t have towels, heat was broken, was fixed close to midnight but then wouldn’t cut off at all, water is brown...found that out when I was trying to give my toddler a bath, mold in the caulking of the tub ",1/5/18,1
"The hotel is actually in a very good location, some of the staff are wonderful, Zac and Caesar on front desk give super helpful service. Josie at the bar was friendly, helpful and probably gave us the best service at a bar I’ve experienced from a bar tender in NYC. I have to say though ROBERT on front desk is probably one of the rudest, unhelpful arrogant, unprofessional, patronising, laziest people I’ve ever met in customer service, I actually witnessed him being rude to another to another guest shortly after his rudeness to myself.The hotel is actually usually very good, I’ve stayed three times now but this individual really lets down the professional standards that the other staff set. P.S Thomas the operations manager is also a very friendly, professional manager who should be working at a 5 star establishment. 4 star for the hotel- 1 for Robert. ",1/5/18,3
"We paid around 300 something / Night which is a lot, and then at the front desk you have a guy who is sniffing permanently. During my check in, a lot of people was complaining and when I arrived in my room, I understood why. I never saw a room small like that in my entire life. A room dirty, with a black carpet fool of I don't know what; the bathroom was something like in 1920 and in front of my window I had two big walls. On the corridor you can smell marijuana, and the sheets on the bed were disgusting. This hotel it's a steal and the service very bad. On what you see on the website it's a lie ",1/5/18,1
"The improvements this hotel has made is fantastic!! Loved our stay once again ! Celebrated our daughters graduation present , ticking off another bucket list dream spending new year in Times Square  ",1/5/18,5
"Poor air conditioning system. It makes a lot of noise and it is impossible to control in the minimum ventilation. Common areas seem like a public space.The catering is fastfood with no other option. There is a comfortable lounge space with some reservation. In the end the account almost doubled, as they require payment of a service fee that was not provided in the booking price, in addition to all tourist taxes ",1/5/18,2
"So close to the theatre district and subway connections. The rooms was small but had everything we needed, including well placed outlets for electronics. Tried a high floor this time and loved having a view. The blackout curtains work great, slept in both days ",1/5/18,5
"Upon arriving at the hotel we did self check in, all was fine. They asked for credit card details as we expected but after checking credit card online statement they also took $200 which was not explained anywhere. We visited reception straight away about it they stated it was hotel policy and we would be refunded within 5 days after checkout. They also stated that the extra fee to pay per night was $30 whereas out travel agents told us it was only $22, so expect this to vary. After checking in we went to our room, after opening the door we were gobsmacked at the size of it. It was tiny with no view apart from a brick wall. We were on floor 14 and the room was right next to 8 elevators. It was VERY VERY noisy, there is no way anyone could sleep in there. We went straight back down to reception and asked to be moved, they didn't even bat an eyelid at giving us a new room so this is obviously a common complaint. The new room was good though, amazing view and was much bigger. This hotel is in a perfect location, just around the corner from times square ",1/5/18,3
"The location was excellent! We walked to Rockefeller Center with no problem. Close proximity to other locations we wanted to visit. The room was very small , however extremely clean, and the staff was very friendly. ",1/5/18,5
"You can't get through to the front desk after you leave. I had trouble with billing that I had to have my credit card company handle because I couldn't get through to any human. The room was small, but the beds were comfortable. I liked the free water bottle and water filling stations. I just wish there was one on every floor! ",1/5/18,3
Rooms were very small and facilities were basic for the money . Do not stay in rooms ending 33 as these are behind the lift and the noise is unbearable. Location good. Staff rude at the check in desk. Check in very busy but as expected in December. Wouldn’t stay again,1/5/18,1
Good location and price near times square and the theater district !!!! . Tkts booth and Restaurant Row right around the corner... Rooms are clean but very very small .. Breakfast is quick and easy .,1/5/18,4
Enjoyable stay. I liked the location particularly. I would consider staying here again. I usually spend the week after Christmas in New York City. The only problem I had was the low water pressure in the shower.,1/5/18,4
"Paid hugely inflated holiday rate (was there for NYE) so this likely affects my review, but first room was horrible. Tiny room and bed: smaller than the double/queen my booking promised. Filthy: surface spills not wiped up, food (I hope) crushed under night table; what looked like fresh blood on sheet, so chances are not changed after last guest — gross! Noisy: next to elevator and heating system that banged away and overheated despite being turned off. Complained after first night and was ""upgraded"" to a larger, quieter, cleaner room with an actual double bed so rest of stay was acceptable. Still, hotel felt poorly maintained with sloppy paint jobs door frames etc. that creates a bad overall impression. Convenient location to Times Square and close enough to subway. Front desk was friendly and helpful, but gets ridiculously busy at check in/check out time ",1/5/18,2
"Great location! Very close to Times Square, able to walk to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Madison Square Garden. Lots of great food options nearby, lots to do and see in the area. Elevators do take a little bit but not a big deal, overall a very good experience ",1/5/18,4
"The service at the front desk was very good. The location of the hotel was excellent. The room very clean, tidy and conditioned although the bed I would have liked queen size. The most I liked was the location and cleanliness ",1/5/18,4
"No one answered the phone for service, mirror dirty, bug in bathroom, eatery closed early, rude, out of items on menu. Dirty vent in bathroom like fuzzy catipiller dirty. Rude staff. Printers in business center didn't work all 4. Staff didn't know where the stairs were. Elevator system terrible when there is a crowd. Quality of remodel poor. ",1/5/18,1
"Booked over 9 months in advanced, they still did not have our room ready for arrival, gave us a downgraded room which was freezing as all windows had a draft, nobody seemed interested in helping resolve the situation and no refund was given despite a downgrade. Bar staff were moody and also uninterested in helping. When we finally got to our reserved room the heating system had a mind of its own and staff again were uninterested and it never got fixed, impossible to sleep due to noise of heater turning on and off constantly throughout the night. Only good thing about this hotel is location, not all staff were bad some were helpful but majority could not be bothered and ruined a large part of our stay. ",1/5/18,1
"We have stayed at the Row NYC Hotel at least 3 times since the name change. There is no way to beat the location for the price. We got a room on the 12th floor and slept very well during our stay. The staff was courteous and helpful, as usual, and assisted us in getting a quiet room and any questions we had regarding the parade. As always, we feel secure that after 8pm only guests are allowed to the elevator access to the rooms by showing a room key. You punch in your floor and are directed to an elevator that delivers you to your floor. We met many people from different countries and enjoyed the interaction. We like the convenience to the theatre district, restaurant district and easy walking distance to times square. They also have an app for room conformation and reservation that we used from the airport to alert the hotel that we would be arriving before the usual check in time. There are computers in the lobby linked to printers for any internet need (ie. boarding passes) It is never difficult to get a taxi when needed and subway access to really close if desired. We received complimentary Row NYC drink containers that came in handy for walking around the city and during the 91st Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. We plan to continue to stay at the Row NYC for any future visits as it truly is our home away from home in NYC ",1/5/18,5
I'm so grateful for everything. I had excellent nights there. I want to go back in the other times. great location. Because the hotel stay at so close to the Time Square and have so many places for to do there. Amazing drinks at the bar.,1/5/18,5
"The location is absolutely perfect. 30 seconds to talk into times square, 10 minute walk to MSG and central to everything. Awesome food and entertainment local too. With this comes loud noise into the night and sirens going off etc. Didn't bother my sleep but did bother people I stayed with.Big negative is the room and bed size! Room images looked bigger and the ""Double Beds"" were not much bigger then a single. Really was pushing the size limit. Room also had a big melted iron mark on the floor. Not a big deal but noticed it for cleanliness ",1/4/18,3
"When we first arrived we were concerned at the size of the room, we had booked a superior room but it seemed very small. On seeing other rooms and chatting to other holiday makers it seems it was actually very good, so be prepared for hotel rooms to be smaller in NYC.I would advise not to opt for breakfast as this is quite expensive but only consists of croissants and cold items. There is a food court across the road which has a basic but freshly cooked menu. The French toast was amazing and you can have bacon, eggs, sausage and a range of beautiful fresh fruit at reasonable prices.Our room was very clean and had an ironing board, iron and hairdryer. There is also air conditioning in each room. There is a concierge in the reception area who can book airport transfers at a cheaper rate than a standard taxi. There is a small shop in the hotel selling juice and snacks at a reasonable price and also a bar which had a good selection of drinks. Given the central location we spent most of our time out and about and it is perfectly placed on the centre of Manhattan for an easy walk to Central Park, Times Square, and the Empire State Building as well as the Flat Iron area. There is a facility to check luggage on a tips only basis.Be prepared for a facilities charge on top of your bill regardless if you use the gym or not. We were charged around an additional $125 for our 5 night stay.I would recommend the hotel based on the location but be prepared for less than you would expect from a European location ",1/4/18,3
"The room service was satisfactory and the employees were kind.The hotel is close to the subway and is in a good position for travelers. However, the room with two queen-size beds is a little too small, although it has four rooms ",1/4/18,4
"We only stayed one night at Row NYC and I was really glad. We selected this as a stopover on our way to visit friends in upstate New York and it wasn’t pleasant. This was a little cheaper than other Manhattan hotels but not cheap enough for us to excuse the tiny room, decaying bathroom and dated decor. Our room was spruced up on a budget - the peeling wallpaper was painted over and the window didn’t close properly. The dark, subway-style interior of the public areas was not my style at all and looking out of the window at night, we saw some sights we’d rather not see. If this is the only way you can do New York, then you’ll still have a great time. If you can afford somewhere else, book somewhere else. I wouldn’t stay again. ",1/4/18,2
"No explanation of charges or deposit on check in, just took credit card, had to ask for clarification later. Reported broken TV concerned it was becoming hot as couldn’t turn it off, nobody came to fix it. Intermittently working heater very noisy. Only plus was the location ",1/4/18,2
"Bad hotel stay never again will i stay here. Ancient TVs in room w/o HDmI connection. Since I’m forced to write more, hotel was sooo bad. Hated it no wonder employees didn’t have Union pins. Place has horrible service ",1/3/18,1
Hotel was in a great location. Needed updating and a good clean. Staff were rude unhelpful and dismissive. Rooms were warm in very cold temperatures. No kettle or fridge. Room was quite expensive so expected higher quality,1/3/18,3
"Favorite ROW HotelNewly renovated hotel. District M on the first floor, the ambiance of this place is great. Relaxing at the bar, sipping great cocktails and guests sitting on the steps. Setting is tastefully done and just feels very homely...great atmosphere. It is a few minutes walk from the Subway and just one stop away from the popular vendors shopping. Breakfast area is spacious and nice. Fresh fruit (nectarine, oranges, apples, and bananas) delish croissant, muffins in addition to all the other hot and cold items.The room is comfortable in every way. I am very happy with the room size, especially the room with a great city view. Front desk staff is very friendly and welcoming. My stay was absolutely perfect on every return year! Thank you ROW! I had recommended friends and they loved it and will certainly be back when in the area. I highly recommend everyone else ",1/3/18,5
"Good hotelGood service in front deskNear to main atractionsAlbeit the hotel was very croud, do to holiday vacations, the service was very good, room very clean, , the elevator was working very fast, no delays. Need to improve the air conditioner equipament, the one in my room was very noise and not well regulated ",1/3/18,4
"I liked the room and great location of the hotel. At the entrance of the hotel there are compudor and printer, this makes it easy to print tickets. Breakfast Tip: GOURMET NEW YORK, is on 8th Ave with W 43rd st, very close, has excellent pancakes and bagel, went there almost every day ",1/3/18,4
"Great hotel - great proximity to theaters and Times Square without being right in the middle of the craziness. Rooms and bathrooms are small, but typical for NY hotels. Always clean and the lobby is vibrant and fun - a great place to hang out ",1/3/18,4
Clean but basic room. Never ate in hotel so cannot offer an opinion. Great lift system.. type floor number on pad and it tells you which of the multiple lifts to use.. never queued. Fantastic central location makes this hotel a winne,1/3/18,4
"My family of 6 booked 2 rooms for one night, and we were very pleased with our rooms. The views were great, the rooms clean and efficient, the amenities outstanding. The elevator system was great since we were on the upper floors and didn't have to spend a lot of time waiting. Enjoyed the breakfast and eating dinner at the City Kitchen. Many choices for our diverse appetites. I'd definitely stay here again ",1/3/18,5
"Staff was helpful in providing a crib for our baby. Room was generally clean. However, there is no coffee machine , refrigderator or microwave. In the winter a microwave alone with a couple utensils can suffice. Overall pleasant experience ",1/3/18,4
"Worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at. The self check in was confusing and there was no one around to ask for help. Our room was extremely tiny, not suitable for two grown adults. It sounded like a train was running above the room constantly (room 1632). We were told it was the elevator, but the elevator was down the hall. We had a view of a back of the building and no one shut their curtains so you could literally see what 50 people were doing in their rooms.. And the worst thing we had to stand on a security line every time we came back into the building to get on the elevator ",1/3/18,1
I thought everyone was really good at what they did and the service was exceptional. The bartenders were extremely good at what they did. They were very attentive to what we needed. The servers as well,1/3/18,5
Staying at The Row was a comfortable experience services was AWESOME CLEAN EXQUISITENESS STAFF! Will be back this summer for sure I felt at home... the staff very respectful and I love the way we have to show our room key for saft,1/3/18,5
"The convenience of the location is the best part of this hotel. City Kitchen also offers a decent food option in the same building. This was useful, as our bus arrived late. It's a short walk to Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue, etc. ",1/3/18,4
I'm a theater goer and being 2 blocks away from TKTS to buy discounted tickets and within walking distance of most theatres is a plus. The staff are helpful and the rooms were all renovated when the Milford became ROW NYC. I'll not stay anywhere else in Manhattan and have established a good rapport with many staff members,1/3/18,5
This was a great hotel and situated in a great location. 5 minutes walk from Times Square. Very clean in public areas and room. Polite and helpful staff in all areas.I would recommend this hotel to all my friends and family,1/3/18,4
"Great stylish Hotel near Time square en Hell's Kitchen. If you stay her you are in the heart of NYC. Easy to reach by Subway, and good to start for sightseeing, shopping or heading out for dinner or bars.We had a really nice stay at the premium queen room o 27th floor! Great view over NYC and the 8 th ave. Free water included ",1/3/18,4
"hotel ideally located in the heart of new york.the hotel is of good quality, but the lack of sound insulation on the bearings is felt. Overall the staff is pleasant.I advise for those who go to the hotel by car, the valet service ",1/2/18,3
"What a disappointment. Having stayed at this hotel in the past, I rebooked due to the excellent location. I had read that the hotel had undergone a complete refurbishment and was relieved as this had clearly been needed when I last stayed. How disappointing my husband and I were when we opened the door to our 'Premium Superior Queen Suite'. Very small - not an issue. Appalling décor, broken 'furniture', fixtures and fittings and not too clean - nothing unhygienic but just very shabby. No tea or coffee making facilities in the room, which would not be too much to ask at the price we paid for this hotel. Would not stay at this hotel again ",1/2/18,1
Had no sleep from the malfunctioning heater in the room. I had someone else's blood on my sheets. I was charged an extra fee $65 after paying for my hotel upfront with Expedia and told nothing could be done because it was booked outside the hotel. Such a terrible experience,1/2/18,2
"Stay somewhere else! Room heater continued to run, even though shutoff, and warm disturbingly loud! Room was dirty and was charged a nightly increased fee for an 'upper' floor but was assigned the eighth floor which is nearly ground level. No coffee in the room and bathroom was dirty. I would recommend staying somewhere else as the rate was no bargain ",1/2/18,2
"If you stay here, specify a room far from the elevators! I'm not usually bothered by elevator noise, but these sound like trains rumbling by. The lobby is chaotic and confusing; security is spotty, with staff only sometimes checking room keys to allow access to elevators. Rooms are tiny, but beds are very comfy and internet is free and works well. ",1/2/18,3
"Best deal in time square! My son is a performer in one of the Broadway shows. So it is perfect for the thesis, restaurants, shopping, etc! This was my 3 time last year. I should get bonus points:) check in is not so good. You need get past this, ",1/2/18,4
"This is a typically small NYC hotel, the room was clean and the bathroom tiny. The negative was that although the lobby was updated, the hallway smelled like urine. The elevator set up is great, no long waits stopping on multiple floors. Can’t beat the location if you are taking in a show. The bed was comfy and the room fairly quiet. ",1/2/18,3
"Poor service but great location. The room was too small and there was no even basic facilities like fridge, blow dryer and coffee maker in the room. Don’t expect a high end hotel. Everything is very very basi ",1/2/18,2
"This is my second year staying at this hotel, the location is AMAZING. just a short 2-3 minute walk to Times Square, about a 20ish minute walk to Central Park, and every other tourist attraction is in a close proximity. The staff is always super helpful, and they have a place to hold your bags - LOVE the men who helped us with our bags...so nice! The view from the room is so amazing. Being from Florida I don’t have views like this. I have no complaints about this hotel whatsoever. Stay here! ",1/2/18,5
"Disappointed,cleanliness, parking. I called several times before I arrived and everything that I was told, for my family Christmas trip did not happen. Very frustrating since this was their Christmas present. I understand that it was the holidays. I reserved 4 rooms, 10 months in advance, this was not a last minute trip. I will not be back to this establishment ",1/2/18,2
"Small room, even though I booked a larger one. Location was good, near Time Square and theatres. The place was nothing fancy, but it fulfilled my need. I wouldn't book it for a vacation stay if my wife was with me ",1/2/18,3
Good stay  good location  no problems  staff good  Enjoyed my stay  small bath could use more shelves and towel hooks. Didn’t find the bar too friendly. News stand didn’t carry local papers. Elevators very efficient,1/2/18,4
"Heating system to noisy, impossible to sleep! Frontdesk attention very poor by phone! And I found pantties from the previous guest in my room...so...all said. It is a pitty because the location is great ",1/2/18,2
"We frequent the Row NYC often and always enjoy our stay. On our recent visit we got a nice surprise by a room upgrade with treats waiting in the room, great way to start our weekend. We’ll be back! Thank you Maurizio Bonivento. ",1/2/18,5
"We were very content with the overall experience. The hotel is centrally located to everything, and the staff are very nice and helpful. The young lady at the front desk was wonderful and gave us great suggestions to maximize our NYC experience when asked. Love the decor and atmosphere of the hotel, it feels like an escape from the chaos of the outside world. Absolutely loved the beds - I cannot remember when I slept so well and comfortably - like sleeping on a cloud. Will definitely be staying at ROW NYC again ",1/2/18,5
everything was perfect the location of the hotel is ideal and the attention is excellent .. if you would put more staff in the reception.. and the rooms a little more comfortable for having been a luxury roo,1/2/18,3
"Perfectly located near a subway station, broadway theatres, Time Square, Hell's kitchen food streets. Hassle free 3 days stay in NY was made easy. A stone throw away from the musicals (Hello Dolly! & Kinky Boots) I was watching really helped especially with bitter cold.The rooms are nothing to shout about. But the location was perfect for me ",1/2/18,4
"I had stayed here many year back when it was the Milford Plaza, Place has been cleaned up since it's in a great location hotel is clean, Room was cleaned by very professional staff every day, I had a query re the safe in the room and within two minutes staff member was at the door and reset the safe. There are obviously much nicer places to stay in NYC but I'd rather stay at ROW for a decent price and spend the cash in NYC ! ",1/2/18,5
"The hotel was in a great location, but when I got there check out was at 4:00pm at I was there at 10.30, then going to the concierge to get info , they were not friendly . When I checked in the desk clerk said he have someone take care of bring my bags up in the room that was put up for me when I checked in , I got to the room and waited for almost two hours for my bags, then I had to call for my bags, the clerk never gave the guys my bags they were not given my baggage tags. The carpet was really dirty. ",1/2/18,2
"We had a very nice stay at your hotel. We liked that we were able to check out, but leave luggage in check room, so we can still see attractions in NY. Then pick up bags afterwards to leave.We had a great view from our room ",1/2/18,4
"Very small room for four people, aware this is a Midtown Manhattan thing. Wont say hotel is dirty, but it is not clean and many of the trolleys the cleaning staff are using are standing in the gangways.We stayed over NYE, extremely busy which meant long waiting hours for elevators ",1/2/18,2
"Room and bathroom are on the smaller side. TV remote was missing. Room was clean, bed comfy! Check in and checkout was a breeze. Put on 19th floor with great city view. Price was a good value. Would definitely go back again ",1/2/18,4
"Ideally located for Times Square, Broadway theatres, restaurants and much more. Well appointed rooms - albeit a little on the small side - and a check in (by Junior) was fantastic. Lift / elevator system slow. Thank you ",1/2/18,5
"This hotel has great access to Times Square and therefore, to the whole public transport system.The city kitchen has great options to eat. The staff was short of rude. The check in girl was particularly unpleasant. Wouldn’t have minded leaving on the spot if it wasn’t because our room was already paid for.Our amazon packages had to be repeatedly claimed to get them (don’t know what would’ve happened if we didn’t claim them).It is not true that they provide free wi-fi and it is not until you book and pay that they send an email that says that you will be charged $33/per night at your arrival!!! I thought that was preposterous. The room was small and the cleaning was so so...It was an overall lousy stay at that hotel. ",1/2/18,1
"Tried getting a hold of the front desk three times and the first I was transferred to reservation and they transferred me back to the front desk where I was put on hold for 10 minutes then hung up on, called back and was transferred to a guest room which really confused the guest ... third time I asked if I could request an early check in and was told they would find out and put me on hold and forgot about me I'm assuming because I only waiting 20 minutes then hung up. When I got to the hotel I was told the upgrade I requested was. Or available for early check in so I said it didn't matter I would take anything ! She then asked for a form a credit card for incidentals because I payed on Expedia (I know hotels hate third party's but I was using points and that the website my rewards program used) and she told us the incidentals were $50 but didn't mention the $16 upgrade charge or $30 facility fee which I would have paid cash for if I would have known. So the next morning when I got the receipt I was shocked to see I was still charged for the upgrade and had an unexpected fee. I work for the hyatt and we get a lot of complaints over not telling people what you are charging them for but I also don't like confrontation so maybe out of my review there can be a training opportunity so people who are looking for a reason to get free stuff or refunds don't get the service I did. ",1/1/18,2
"Check in was slow and staff was rude. Heater in the room made tons of clanking noise every time it turned on. Bath tub was dirty. I ordered a coffee from the bar in the morning and the bartender told me it was on the house. After I added cream and sugar, another bartender called me over and made me pay $3.50 for drip coffee. I let him know it's not right since the other employee said it was free. He did not care and required I pay. For $300, I felt ripped off. ",1/1/18,1
"Great location, very close proximity to all the theaters, nice hotels, and Carnegie Hall, and central park. If you don't spend too much time in room, it is fine. The food court downstairs are very handy ",1/1/18,3
"Row Hotel is an old building in Midtown Manhattan verte close to Time Square and Broadway' s theatres. This flirty hotel it has been renovated so it has functional tiny rooms, we stayed in 22° floor. Conected with Subway and Port Authority Bus Terminal. ",1/1/18,4
"Having lived in NYC, we always stay at the Row when we return home to visit. It's centrally located to all the splendors the city has to offer. The rooms are comfortable, clean and welcoming. The staff has always been great. Thanks ",1/1/18,5
"This hotel is in a great location but it is BUSY and noisy. It looks great as you arrive with a nice bar area. But then you get to your room, decent enough size and decent bed but the bathroom is tired and grotty, when you shower you feel like you're on a ship as the bottom of the bath has come away from the underneath. However the worst aspect is the continuous drown of the outside extractor fan that runs the length of the building, your may also be unlucky and get a room near the ever whoosing elevators. But the main infuriating issue is the archaic heating with a mind of its own that screams and screeches into action at 2am then 4am, even when the thermostat says off. What's worse is that when you complain they are already aware of the issues "" yes its the ventilation, it cannot be helped"" well I suggest you do something to fix these major issues that the ever increasing customer expects, then rather than have grumpy unhappy guests that haven't slept, perhaps they will then spend more money in your bar! I would think twice about staying here if you're a couple, boys hols it might be suitable, but only just. This is without doubt the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in. ",1/1/18,2
"It’s in a good place of NYC. People very kind, but I think that room was a litte small and we have some problems with bad smell in the bathroom. I had a good time there, but definitely I will try another place in my next visit to NYC ",1/1/18,3
"We always enjoy the ROW NYC experience. Used to come here as the Milford Plaza! It is close walking distance to many theatres and Times Square. Nice fitness center, clean rooms. We will be back. Check in is a breeze. ",1/1/18,4
